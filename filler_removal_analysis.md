# Filler Removal Analysis

## Key Finding
The "protected phrases" aren't being protected by our PROTECTED_PHRASES regex - they're being preserved because our removal patterns don't match them in the first place!

## How It Actually Works

### Test 3 Analysis:
Input: "You know what I mean..." and "but you know sometimes..."

1. **"You know what I mean"** - Preserved because:
   - FILLER_YOU_KNOW pattern requires "you know," (with comma)
   - FILLER_YOU_KNOW_NO_COMMA only matches "you know the/it/that/this/they/we"
   - Neither pattern matches "you know what"

2. **"but you know sometimes"** - Preserved because:
   - No comma after "know"
   - "sometimes" is not in the pattern list

## The Good News
This conservative behavior is actually excellent! We're only removing fillers when we're very confident (they have commas or match specific patterns).

## Fixed Issues
1. **Regex Pattern Fixed**: The PROTECTED_PHRASES regex had newlines that prevented it from compiling correctly. Now it's a single line.

## Current Behavior Summary

### What Gets Removed:
- "you know," (with comma)
- "I mean," (with comma) 
- "So" at sentence start
- "Well," at sentence start
- "Actually" at sentence start
- Basic fillers: "um", "uh", "ah"

### What Doesn't Get Removed:
- "you know" without comma (unless followed by specific words)
- "I mean" without comma at sentence start
- "like" without specific context
- Any protected phrases

## Recommendation
Keep the current conservative approach. It's better to miss some fillers than to accidentally remove meaningful content.
