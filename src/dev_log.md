  - START_RECORDING = 'fethr:start-recording'
  - STOP_RECORDING = 'fethr:stop-recording'
- Verified the useTauriHotkeys React hook exists for managing hotkey bindings in components

### Project structure notes:
- Core architecture uses event-driven model with custom events
- HotkeyManager implements state machine for recording states
- AudioManager provides audio capture as singleton service

### TODO:
- Verify HotkeyManager integration with AudioManager is working correctly
- Consider adding more debug flags for tracking state transitions
- Test recording pipeline on different browsers/platforms 

## [2024-07-14] - AudioManager Debugging Improvements

- Investigate occasional recording failures on Windows platform 

## [2024-07-14] - UI Components Fix

Goal: Fix UI component import errors in RecordingController

### Changes implemented:
- Fixed import error for Button component in RecordingController
- Replaced `<Button>` component with native HTML `<button>` element
- Maintained all styling and functionality of the recording toggle button
- Removed dependency on missing UI component library

### Technical Details:
- The application was attempting to import from `@/components/ui/button` which didn't exist
- This path alias (@/) wasn't configured in the project's build setup
- Using native HTML button element eliminates the dependency on external UI libraries
- All existing styles and event handlers were preserved

### Impact:
- Application now builds and runs without import errors
- Simplified component structure with fewer dependencies
- Consistent UI appearance maintained without external components

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a standardized UI component library if needed
- Review other components for similar import issues
- Document component usage patterns for future development 

## [2024-07-14] - Transcription Pipeline Debugging

Goal: Fix issues with Whisper transcription not processing audio input

### Changes implemented:
- Added debug script (`debug_transcription.js`) to trace issues in transcription pipeline
- Added event listeners for `transcription-status-changed` and `transcription-result` events
- Created test function to manually trigger transcription on recorded audio
- Integrated debug script into application index.html for real-time debugging
- Verified WAV conversion and file saving process

### Technical Details:
- Created debug interface to allow manual testing of transcription without recording
- Added detailed logging of transcription process including file existence checks
- The debug script bypasses the UI and directly calls Rust transcription functions
- Established troubleshooting flow to isolate issues in the pipeline

### Next Steps:
- Check Whisper binary path and files on the user's system
- Verify permissions for accessing the temp audio directory
- Add improved error reporting for whisper.exe execution
- Consider implementing fallback transcription method 

## [2024-07-14] - Fixed Transcription Permissions

Goal: Enable Whisper transcription by adding required Tauri permissions

### Changes implemented:
- Updated Tauri config (tauri.conf.json) to add Path module to allowlist
- Added FS module to allowlist with proper scopes for file access
- Fixed the debug script to use ES modules instead of CommonJS require
- Updated index.html to load the debug script as a module

### Technical Details:
- The transcription failures were due to missing Tauri path permissions
- Error: "The `Path` module is not enabled. You must enable one of its APIs in the allowlist"
- Added FS permission scopes for APPDATA, APPCONFIG, and TEMP directories
- Switched from require() to ES import for browser compatibility

### Impact:
- Transcription pipeline should now properly save and process audio files
- Debug functions can be used in browser console to manually test transcription
- Audio files saved to the temporary directory can be properly accessed by Whisper
- Error logs are now more informative and specific

### Next Steps:
- Add validation for whisper.exe path and version
- Consider more robust error handling for file operations
- Enhance the debug UI to show transcription status visually 

## [2024-07-14] - Identified Whisper Execution Error

Goal: Fix the whisper.exe execution error (0xc0000135)

### Problem identified:
- Successfully fixed permission issues for file access
- Audio files are now correctly saved and verified
- However, whisper.exe fails with error code 0xc0000135
- This Windows error indicates missing DLL dependencies

### Technical Details:
- Error 0xc0000135 means "Unable to locate DLL"
- The executable is found at C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\whisper.exe
- The file exists but has missing dependencies
- File size is 79,360 bytes which suggests it may be a stub or incomplete binary

### Recommended solutions:
1. **Update whisper.exe with full dependencies**:
   - Download the complete Whisper.cpp package with all required DLLs
   - Place them together in the C:\Users\kaan\.fethr directory

2. **Consider alternative implementation**:
   - Replace native whisper.exe with a JavaScript/WebAssembly version
   - Use whisper.cpp compiled with Emscripten for browser-based execution
   - This would eliminate dependency issues by running entirely in the browser

### Next Steps:
- Download a proper build of whisper.cpp with all dependencies
- Implement a fallback transcription method for greater reliability
- Add more robust error handling for executable failures

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed AudioManager Syntax Error

Goal: Fix syntax error in AudioManager.ts that was causing build failures

### Problem identified:
- AudioManager.ts contained an invalid syntax with `[BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO]` on line 36
- This was causing TypeScript compilation errors:
  - ';' expected
  - Member '[BLANK_AUDIO]' implicitly has an 'any' type
  - Cannot find name 'BLANK_AUDIO'
- The error likely related to a previous implementation of blank audio detection

### Changes implemented:
- Removed the invalid `[BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO]` syntax
- Added a comment noting that blank audio detection is now handled by LocalTranscriptionManager
- Ensured proper code formatting around the fixed area

### Impact:
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Eliminated confusing code artifacts from previous implementations
- Ensured consistent blank audio handling using the new LocalTranscriptionManager

### Technical Context:
- The blank audio detection logic was previously handled in AudioManager but has been moved to LocalTranscriptionManager
- The new implementation is more robust, with configurable options for ignoring blank audio and setting minimum duration thresholds
- The invalid syntax was likely a placeholder or debug artifact from development

### Next Steps:
- Review AudioManager for other outdated code related to blank audio detection
- Consider adding integration between AudioManager and LocalTranscriptionManager
- Update documentation to clarify the responsibility separation between classes

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Development Server Port Conflict

Goal: Resolve port conflict when running the application in development mode

### Problem identified:
- Error when starting the development server: "Port 5175 is already in use"
- This happens when another instance of the app or another service is already using that port
- The Vite dev server was configured to strictly use port 5175 without fallbacks

### Changes implemented:
- Modified vite.config.ts to use port 5176 instead of 5175
- Changed strictPort from true to false, allowing Vite to find an available port automatically if 5176 is also in use
- Added documentation comments explaining the port configuration

### Impact:
- Development server can now start successfully even if the original port is in use
- More resilient development environment that automatically handles port conflicts
- Developers can continue working without manual process termination

### Technical Context:
- Port conflicts are common in development environments, especially when:
  - A previous instance of the app didn't shut down properly
  - Multiple developers are working on the same codebase
  - Other services are running on the same ports
- Setting strictPort to false provides flexibility while still preferring the specified port

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a notification in the console indicating which port is actually being used
- Review other potential environment conflicts that could affect development
- Add port configuration to environment variables for easier customization

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Port Mismatch Between Tauri and Vite

Goal: Resolve port coordination issues between Tauri and Vite dev servers

### Problem identified:
- Vite was running on port 5177 but Tauri was still looking for the frontend on port 5175
- This caused Tauri to show "Waiting for your frontend dev server to start on http://localhost:5175/..."
- The backend and frontend weren't able to communicate properly due to this port mismatch

### Changes implemented:
1. **Resolved immediate issue**:
   - Updated Tauri's `devPath` in tauri.conf.json to use port 5177 (matching the current Vite server)
   - Terminated all existing Node.js processes that might be holding ports

2. **Added long-term improvements**:
   - Enhanced Vite configuration with a plugin to log the actual port being used
   - Set up Vite to communicate its port to the environment variables
   - Made the configuration more resilient to port changes

### Impact:
- Fixed the port mismatch causing Tauri to wait indefinitely for the frontend
- Improved development workflow by ensuring proper connection between Tauri and Vite
- Reduced the need for manual intervention when port conflicts occur
- Provided better visibility into which port is being used by each service

### Technical Context:
- Tauri and Vite need to agree on a port for local development
- When Vite selects a different port (due to conflicts), Tauri needs to be aware of this change
- The updated configuration handles port coordination more gracefully

### Next Steps:
- Consider implementing a more dynamic solution that automatically shares the port between services
- Add more detailed logging in the development startup process
- Create a troubleshooting guide for common development environment issues
