- Added FS module to allowlist with proper scopes for file access
- Fixed the debug script to use ES modules instead of CommonJS require
- Updated index.html to load the debug script as a module

### Technical Details:
- The transcription failures were due to missing Tauri path permissions
- Error: "The `Path` module is not enabled. You must enable one of its APIs in the allowlist"
- Added FS permission scopes for APPDATA, APPCONFIG, and TEMP directories
- Switched from require() to ES import for browser compatibility

### Impact:
- Transcription pipeline should now properly save and process audio files
- Debug functions can be used in browser console to manually test transcription
- Audio files saved to the temporary directory can be properly accessed by Whisper
- Error logs are now more informative and specific

### Next Steps:
- Add validation for whisper.exe path and version
- Consider more robust error handling for file operations
- Enhance the debug UI to show transcription status visually 

## [2024-07-14] - Identified Whisper Execution Error

Goal: Fix the whisper.exe execution error (0xc0000135)

### Problem identified:
- Successfully fixed permission issues for file access
- Audio files are now correctly saved and verified
- However, whisper.exe fails with error code 0xc0000135
- This Windows error indicates missing DLL dependencies

### Technical Details:
- Error 0xc0000135 means "Unable to locate DLL"
- The executable is found at C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\whisper.exe
- The file exists but has missing dependencies
- File size is 79,360 bytes which suggests it may be a stub or incomplete binary

### Recommended solutions:
1. **Update whisper.exe with full dependencies**:
   - Download the complete Whisper.cpp package with all required DLLs
   - Place them together in the C:\Users\kaan\.fethr directory

2. **Consider alternative implementation**:
   - Replace native whisper.exe with a JavaScript/WebAssembly version
   - Use whisper.cpp compiled with Emscripten for browser-based execution
   - This would eliminate dependency issues by running entirely in the browser

### Next Steps:
- Download a proper build of whisper.cpp with all dependencies
- Implement a fallback transcription method for greater reliability
- Add more robust error handling for executable failures

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed AudioManager Syntax Error

Goal: Fix syntax error in AudioManager.ts that was causing build failures

### Problem identified:
- AudioManager.ts contained an invalid syntax with `[BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO]` on line 36
- This was causing TypeScript compilation errors:
  - ';' expected
  - Member '[BLANK_AUDIO]' implicitly has an 'any' type
  - Cannot find name 'BLANK_AUDIO'
- The error likely related to a previous implementation of blank audio detection

### Changes implemented:
- Removed the invalid `[BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO][BLANK_AUDIO]` syntax
- Added a comment noting that blank audio detection is now handled by LocalTranscriptionManager
- Ensured proper code formatting around the fixed area

### Impact:
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Eliminated confusing code artifacts from previous implementations
- Ensured consistent blank audio handling using the new LocalTranscriptionManager

### Technical Context:
- The blank audio detection logic was previously handled in AudioManager but has been moved to LocalTranscriptionManager
- The new implementation is more robust, with configurable options for ignoring blank audio and setting minimum duration thresholds
- The invalid syntax was likely a placeholder or debug artifact from development

### Next Steps:
- Review AudioManager for other outdated code related to blank audio detection
- Consider adding integration between AudioManager and LocalTranscriptionManager
- Update documentation to clarify the responsibility separation between classes

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Development Server Port Conflict

Goal: Resolve port conflict when running the application in development mode

### Problem identified:
- Error when starting the development server: "Port 5175 is already in use"
- This happens when another instance of the app or another service is already using that port
- The Vite dev server was configured to strictly use port 5175 without fallbacks

### Changes implemented:
- Modified vite.config.ts to use port 5176 instead of 5175
- Changed strictPort from true to false, allowing Vite to find an available port automatically if 5176 is also in use
- Added documentation comments explaining the port configuration

### Impact:
- Development server can now start successfully even if the original port is in use
- More resilient development environment that automatically handles port conflicts
- Developers can continue working without manual process termination

### Technical Context:
- Port conflicts are common in development environments, especially when:
  - A previous instance of the app didn't shut down properly
  - Multiple developers are working on the same codebase
  - Other services are running on the same ports
- Setting strictPort to false provides flexibility while still preferring the specified port

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a notification in the console indicating which port is actually being used
- Review other potential environment conflicts that could affect development
- Add port configuration to environment variables for easier customization

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Port Mismatch Between Tauri and Vite

Goal: Resolve port coordination issues between Tauri and Vite dev servers

### Problem identified:
- Vite was running on port 5177 but Tauri was still looking for the frontend on port 5175
- This caused Tauri to show "Waiting for your frontend dev server to start on http://localhost:5175/..."
- The backend and frontend weren't able to communicate properly due to this port mismatch

### Changes implemented:
1. **Resolved immediate issue**:
   - Updated Tauri's `devPath` in tauri.conf.json to use port 5177 (matching the current Vite server)
   - Terminated all existing Node.js processes that might be holding ports

2. **Added long-term improvements**:
   - Enhanced Vite configuration with a plugin to log the actual port being used
   - Set up Vite to communicate its port to the environment variables
   - Made the configuration more resilient to port changes

### Impact:
- Fixed the port mismatch causing Tauri to wait indefinitely for the frontend
- Improved development workflow by ensuring proper connection between Tauri and Vite
- Reduced the need for manual intervention when port conflicts occur
- Provided better visibility into which port is being used by each service

### Technical Context:
- Tauri and Vite need to agree on a port for local development
- When Vite selects a different port (due to conflicts), Tauri needs to be aware of this change
- The updated configuration handles port coordination more gracefully

### Next Steps:
- Consider implementing a more dynamic solution that automatically shares the port between services
- Add more detailed logging in the development startup process
- Create a troubleshooting guide for common development environment issues

## [2024-07-16] - Implemented LiveWaveform Component for Recording Visualization

Goal: Add real-time visualization of microphone input during recording

### Changes implemented:
1. **Created new LiveWaveform component**:
   - Implemented `src/components/LiveWaveform.tsx` using React hooks
   - Set up Web Audio API with AudioContext and AnalyserNode
   - Added dynamic visualization based on frequency data from microphone input
   - Implemented initialization with getUserMedia and proper cleanup

2. **Integrated into RecordingPill.tsx**:
   - Replaced static WaveformPlaceholder with the new dynamic LiveWaveform component
   - Ensured proper display in the recording state
   - Maintained the existing layout and styling

### Technical Details:
- Used React's useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback hooks for state management
- Implemented Web Audio API pipeline: MediaStream → AudioContext → AnalyserNode
- Created animation loop using requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- Used Uint8Array and getByteFrequencyData for real-time audio analysis
- Added comprehensive cleanup to stop all audio processes on unmount

### Impact:
- Improved user experience with visual feedback showing actual recording levels
- Added more professional and polished feel to the recording interface
- Provided users with confirmation that audio is being captured correctly
- Enhanced the modern aesthetic of the application

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding sensitivity controls for the visualization
- Explore different visualization styles (waveform vs. frequency bars)
- Add option to customize colors or animation styles
- Potentially integrate visualization data with audio level detection for blank audio identification

## [2024-07-17] - Improved LiveWaveform Visualization With Better Frequency Distribution

Goal: Fix the LiveWaveform component to ensure all bars react appropriately to audio input

### Problem identified:
- Only the left half of the waveform bars were showing activity while the right half remained at minimum height
- The layout in RecordingPill might have been constraining the waveform width
- The frequency analysis algorithm was likely skewed towards lower frequencies
- Needed logging to verify calculated bar heights for debugging

### Changes implemented:
1. **Improved RecordingPill layout**:
   - Changed layout from `justify-end` to `justify-between` to ensure proper spacing
   - Added explicit `w-full` to the waveform container div to ensure full width
   - Adjusted padding to ensure consistent spacing

2. **Enhanced frequency analysis algorithm**:
   - Increased FFT size from 64 to 128 for better frequency resolution
   - Implemented logarithmic frequency distribution to better represent human hearing
   - Used a power curve to allocate more bars to lower frequencies but ensure all frequencies are represented
   - Increased scale factor from 150 to 200 for more visible bar height differences

3. **Added comprehensive logging**:
   - Added throttled logging of bar heights (once per second) to monitor distribution
   - Added data range logging to verify min/max values in the frequency data
   - Logged analyzer configuration details for debugging

### Technical Details:
- Audio frequency data is naturally concentrated in lower frequencies for speech
- Previous implementation used equal bin sizes which resulted in most activity showing only in first few bars
- New logarithmic distribution maps the full frequency spectrum across all bars with emphasis on the speech range
- Ensured proper cleanup and initialization of counters in component lifecycle

### Impact:
- All bars now show activity in response to audio input
- More visually balanced visualization that better represents the audio
- Improved debugging capabilities with meaningful logs
- Enhanced user feedback with more responsive visualization

### Next Steps:
- Consider fine-tuning the frequency distribution curve based on testing with different voices
- Add option to switch between visualization modes (equal bins vs. logarithmic)
- Explore time-domain visualization as an alternative
- Consider adding color variations based on frequency or amplitude

## [2024-07-17] - Switched LiveWaveform to Time-Domain Visualization

Goal: Create a more responsive visualization by using audio amplitude data instead of frequency data

### Problem identified:
- Voice energy is naturally concentrated in lower frequencies, causing frequency-based visualization to be unbalanced
- Even with logarithmic frequency distribution, the visualization wasn't ideally reactive
- Time-domain (amplitude) data provides a more intuitive representation of audio levels across all bars

### Changes implemented:
1. **Switched to amplitude-based visualization**:
   - Changed from `getByteFrequencyData` to `getByteTimeDomainData` for audio analysis
   - Adjusted buffer length calculation to use `analyser.fftSize` instead of `frequencyBinCount`
   - Increased FFT size from 128 to 256 for better time-domain resolution

2. **Redesigned data processing algorithm**:
   - Implemented analysis based on deviation from silence (128) instead of frequency levels
   - For each bar, we now find the maximum amplitude deviation within its time slice
   - Scaled the amplitude range (0-128) to height percentage with a factor of 250
   - Used simpler, equal-sized time slices for each bar

3. **Updated logging for debugging**:
   - Changed log messages to indicate time-domain data processing
   - Added data range logging specific to time-domain values
   - Maintained throttled logging to avoid console spam

### Technical Details:
- Time-domain data represents audio waveform amplitudes (0-255, with 128 being silence)
- Each bar's height now represents the maximum deviation from silence in its time slice
- This approach is more intuitive as it directly maps loudness to bar height
- Equal-sized time slices work well for amplitude data unlike frequency data

### Impact:
- More dynamic visualization with all bars showing activity based on sound level
- Better representation of actual audio intensity rather than frequency distribution
- More intuitive visual feedback during recording
- Improved responsiveness to all types of vocal input regardless of frequency content

### Next Steps:
- Fine-tune the amplitude scaling factor based on user testing
- Consider adding visualizations for both time and frequency domains
- Explore color variations based on amplitude levels
- Add options for different visualization styles (bars vs. waveform)

## [2024-07-18] - Enhanced LiveWaveform Visual Appearance

Goal: Improve the visual impact and reactivity of the waveform visualization

### Problem identified:
- The time-domain waveform was reacting to audio but appeared visually muted
- Bars often stayed low, making the visualization feel underwhelming
- The styling needed tweaking to create a more polished appearance

### Changes implemented:
1. **Increased amplitude scaling factor**:
   - Boosted the scaling multiplier from 250 to 350 for more pronounced bar height changes
   - Maintained clamping between minimum height and 100% to prevent overflow
   - This makes the visualization more reactive to quieter sounds

2. **Adjusted bar styling for better aesthetics**:
   - Reduced the number of bars from 12 to 10 to allow for wider bars
   - Increased bar width from `w-1` to `w-1.5` for better visibility
   - Increased spacing between bars from `space-x-px` to `space-x-0.5` for cleaner separation
   - Adjusted background opacity from 70% to 80% for better contrast
   - Changed transition from `linear` to `ease-out` with slightly longer duration (0.1s) for smoother movement

### Technical Details:
- The scaling factor directly impacts how audio amplitude translates to visual height
- Fewer, wider bars create a more substantial and readable visualization
- The ease-out transition creates a more natural feel to the bar movement
- Careful balance maintained between responsiveness and visual stability

### Impact:
- More visually striking and reactive waveform visualization
- Better indication of audio levels during recording
- Improved aesthetic quality of the recording interface
- More professional appearance with smoother bar animations

### Next Steps:
- Consider user feedback on the new visual style
- Explore adding subtle color variations based on amplitude
- Test with different audio inputs to ensure balanced visualization
- Consider adding a compact/expanded view option

## [2024-07-18] - Made Waveform Visualization More Compact

Goal: Create a more space-efficient visualization in the recording pill

### Problem identified:
- The waveform visualization was taking up too much horizontal space
- With 10 bars, the component appeared wider than necessary for effective feedback
- Needed to maintain visual quality while reducing the component's footprint

### Changes implemented:
1. **Reduced number of visualization bars**:
   - Decreased the number of bars from 10 to 7 for a more compact appearance
   - This creates a better balance between visual feedback and space efficiency

2. **Adjusted individual bar styling**:
   - Increased bar width from `w-1.5` to `w-2` to make each bar more substantial
   - Increased spacing between bars from `space-x-0.5` to `space-x-1` for better visual separation
   - Maintained the same opacity and transition effects for consistent appearance

### Technical Details:
- Fewer bars means each bar represents a larger slice of the audio buffer
- The wider bars compensate for having fewer elements, maintaining visual impact
- Increased spacing provides better visual distinction between individual bars
- No changes required to the audio analysis algorithm itself

### Impact:
- More compact and space-efficient visualization
- Cleaner appearance with fewer, more substantial bars
- Improved UI balance in the recording pill
- Maintained reactivity and visual feedback quality

### Next Steps:
- Evaluate the compact visualization with different recording durations
- Consider adding a responsive design that adjusts number of bars based on available space
- Collect user feedback on the new compact visualization

## [2024-07-19] - Enhanced Waveform Reactivity and Compactness

Goal: Make the waveform more visually reactive to normal speech and further improve its compactness

### Problem identified:
- The waveform bars barely moved during normal speech, appearing underwhelming
- Even with 7 bars, the visualization could be more compact
- Visual feedback wasn't sensitive enough to register quieter sounds

### Changes implemented:
1. **Dramatically increased visualization sensitivity**:
   - Boosted the amplitude scaling factor from 350 to 700, a significant increase
   - This makes even quieter sounds register visually on the bars
   - Maintained minimum height and maximum (100%) clamping for stability

2. **Further optimized visual compactness**:
   - Further reduced the number of bars from 7 to just 5
   - Adjusted bar width from `w-2` back to `w-1.5` for a cleaner look
   - Maintained `space-x-1` spacing for clear separation
   - Made transitions slightly faster (0.075s instead of 0.1s) for more responsiveness

### Technical Details:
- The higher scaling factor (700) dramatically amplifies small amplitude changes
- With only 5 bars, each bar now represents a larger portion of the audio buffer
- The slightly thinner bars combined with fewer total bars create a very compact visualization
- Faster transitions help the visualization keep up better with rapid audio changes

### Impact:
- Much more reactive visualization that responds to even quiet speech
- Extremely compact presentation that takes minimal horizontal space
- More effective visual feedback during recording
- Better balance between size and functionality

### Next Steps:
- Monitor for potential over-sensitivity during loud speech
- Consider adding different visualization modes (compact, normal, detailed)
- Explore subtle color changes based on amplitude levels
- Consider adding a small visual indicator when audio is completely silent
