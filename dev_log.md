- Add animations for smoother transitions between states

## [2024-09-20] - Implemented Backend Commands for Settings Page
Goal: Create the Tauri commands needed for the Settings page functionality

### Changes Made:
- Added three new backend commands in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:
  - `get_settings`: Retrieves current application settings from the SETTINGS global
  - `save_settings`: Updates and persists application settings to the configuration file
  - `get_available_models`: Discovers available Whisper model files in the vendor/models directory
- Enhanced imports to include necessary dependencies:
  - Added `fs` module for directory operations
  - Added `log` crate for better logging
  - Added `State` from Tauri for dependency injection
- Implemented platform-specific path resolution for model discovery:
  - Debug mode uses CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR to locate the vendor directory
  - Release mode uses Tauri's resource resolver to find bundled resources
- Added detailed logging throughout the commands for better diagnosability

### Technical Details:
- The `get_settings` command accesses the global SETTINGS mutex, clones the contents, and returns them to the frontend
- The `save_settings` command updates the global SETTINGS and calls the `save` method to persist changes to disk
- The `get_available_models` command scans for .bin files in the models directory and returns their filenames
- Added proper error handling for all file operations and mutex access

### Impact:
- Enables frontend settings UI to retrieve and update application configuration
- Provides a list of available model files for model selection dropdown
- Creates a foundation for extending settings functionality in the future
- Ensures consistent settings management across debug and release builds

### Next Steps:
- Implement frontend React components for the Settings page
- Connect frontend UI to these backend commands
- Test configuration changes and persistence
- Consider adding additional settings options for future features

## [2024-09-19] - FFmpeg Bundling and Path Resolution
Goal: Bundle FFmpeg with the application and properly resolve its path across platforms

### Changes Made:
- Modified `tauri.conf.json` to include FFmpeg in the externalBin array:
  - Added `"vendor/ffmpeg"` alongside the existing `"vendor/whisper"` entry
  - This ensures FFmpeg is bundled with the application on all platforms

- Enhanced `transcription.rs` with improved FFmpeg handling:
  - Added proper imports: `std::process::{Command, Stdio}`
  - Replaced the synchronous `convert_to_wav_predictable` function with an async `run_ffmpeg_conversion` function
  - Implemented platform-specific path resolution for FFmpeg in both debug and release modes
  - Added executable existence checks with detailed error messaging
  - Improved command execution with proper working directory settings
  - Enhanced output verification to ensure valid WAV file generation

### Technical Details:
- Debug mode now resolves FFmpeg from the source vendor directory using `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`
- Release mode resolves FFmpeg from next to the main executable, with proper platform-specific naming
- Platform-specific binary names are handled with conditional compilation:
  ```rust
  let release_ffmpeg_name = if cfg!(target_os = "windows") { "ffmpeg.exe" } else { "ffmpeg" };
  ```
- Added detailed logging for path resolution and command execution

### Impact:
- More robust audio processing across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Consistent FFmpeg availability without requiring system-installed version
- Better error handling with detailed diagnostics
- Clean separation of debug vs. release path resolution

### Next Steps:
- Test FFmpeg bundling across different platforms
- Consider adding more audio processing options
- Explore optimizing FFmpeg parameters for better voice quality

## [2024-09-19] - Improved Cross-Platform Resource Bundling
Goal: Enhance Fethr's cross-platform compatibility and resource handling

### Changes Made:
- Modified `tauri.conf.json` for better resource bundling:
  - Updated external binary configuration to use platform-agnostic path `"vendor/whisper"` instead of `"vendor/whisper.exe"`
  - Added resources configuration for the models directory with `"vendor/models"` to ensure models are properly bundled

- Improved `config.rs` for simplified settings management:
  - Removed `whisper_directory` field from AppSettings as it's now handled directly by the app
  - Renamed `whisper_model` to `model_name` for clarity
  - Added `language` field to provide explicit language control
  - Added specific type annotation for TOML parsing with `toml::from_str::<AppSettings>`
  - Enhanced settings loading and saving with improved error handling

- Enhanced `transcription.rs` for robust path resolution:
  - Added platform-specific path handling that works correctly in both debug and release modes
  - Implemented proper detection of debug vs. release environments
  - Used Tauri's `resource_dir()` API for resolving bundled resources in release mode
  - Added OS detection for correct binary naming across Windows, macOS and Linux
  - Removed clipboard/paste operations that were causing redundant actions

- Refactored `audio_manager_rs.rs` for better clipboard handling:
  - Ensured clipboard operations happen only once
  - Moved clipboard/paste functionality out of the transcription module
  - Fixed auto-paste logic to prevent unintended double paste operations

- Removed unnecessary safety timer from `App.tsx` that was forcing state reset after 5 seconds

### Technical Details:
- Debug mode now correctly resolves paths using `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`
- Release mode uses Tauri's resource directory API for bundled resources
- Platform-specific binary naming is handled with conditional compilation:
  ```rust
  if cfg!(target_os = "windows") {
     "whisper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe"
  } else if cfg!(target_os = "macos") {
     if cfg!(target_arch = "aarch64") {
         "whisper-aarch64-apple-darwin"
     } else {
         "whisper-x86_64-apple-darwin"
     }
  }
  ```
- Improved path resolution handles the different locations between debug and release builds

### Impact:
- More robust cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Consistent resource bundling that works correctly in production builds
- Better separation of concerns between transcription and clipboard operations
- Improved error handling with more detailed logging
- Cleaner and more maintainable codebase with proper separation of functionality

### Next Steps:
- Implement comprehensive testing across platforms to verify compatibility
- Add platform-specific build scripts to automate bundling for all targets
- Consider adding configuration option for custom model directories
- Explore additional optimization for ARM architectures

## [2024-09-18] - Improved Timeout Handling with Cancel Action
Goal: Improve the timeout handling in the Rust backend to trigger a stop and transcribe action

### Changes Made:
- Removed the `TimeoutResetAndEmitUi` variant from the `PostEventAction` enum
- Added back `CancelRecordingAndEmitUi` with a repurposed function to trigger stop and transcribe
- Modified the state thread timeout logic:
  - Kept the state reset to Idle
  - Kept clearing the timer flag
  - Removed direct emit_state_update call
  - Set timeout_action to CancelRecordingAndEmitUi
- Restored and enhanced the timeout action handling in the state thread loop:
  - The action now first emits an Idle state to update UI immediately
  - Then triggers the stop/transcribe flow to clean up audio

### Technical Details:
- This approach provides a cleaner cancellation path that:
  - Properly cleans up any recording that may have started
  - Updates the UI to show the cancellation
  - Maintains a consistent event flow whether cancellation is from a timeout or user action
- The frontend listener for `fethr-stop-and-transcribe` will handle the result (likely a blank audio message) 
  and trigger the reset signal correctly
- The error message "Tap cancelled" is displayed to provide user feedback

### Impact:
- More consistent handling of timeout scenarios
- Proper cleanup of recording resources when a timeout occurs
- Better user feedback during cancellation
- Simplified state handling logic with more uniform event flow

### Next Steps:
- Monitor log output to verify the cancel action is working as expected
- Consider adding analytics to track how often timeouts/cancellations occur
- Fine-tune timeout parameters if needed based on user feedback

## [2024-09-18] - Reverted Timeout Handling to Direct UI Updates
Goal: Simplify timeout handling by removing unnecessary audio processing

### Changes Made:
- Removed the `CancelRecordingAndEmitUi` variant from the `PostEventAction` enum
- Modified the state thread timeout logic:
  - Kept the state reset to Idle
  - Kept clearing the timer flag
  - Restored direct Idle state UI updates after timeout detection
  - Removed the timeout_action variable and handling block
- Simplified error handling for timeout edge cases

### Technical Details:
- This approach is cleaner for our use case because:
  - No audio recording is started in WaitingForSecondTap state, so no need to stop/cleanup
  - Directly updating the UI provides immediate feedback without unnecessary backend operations
  - Error messages in timeout cases are more specific ("Tap cancelled (Timeout)" vs generic "Tap cancelled")
- The timeout window logic remains the same, only the action taken on timeout is simpler

### Impact:
- More efficient handling of timeout scenarios
- Clear separation between UI state updates and audio recording operations
- Simplified control flow in the state thread loop

## [2024-09-18] – Session Start
Goal: Implement and enhance the Fethr application based on the project requirements

### Analysis of Current State:
- Application uses Tauri with Rust backend and React/TypeScript frontend
- Global hotkey system using RightAlt key for recording control
- Audio recording with WebM to WAV conversion
- Local Whisper transcription using whisper.exe

### Planned Improvements:
- Enhance state machine reliability in the Rust backend
- Improve audio quality for better transcription results
- Add more comprehensive debugging features
- Ensure smooth transitions between recording states
- Document all changes thoroughly

### Initial Tasks:
- Review the current state machine implementation for potential race conditions
- Examine the timeout handling logic in the callback function
- Verify lock usage patterns to prevent deadlocks
- Review audio recording process for optimization opportunities
- Update the dev_log.md with detailed explanations of all changes

### Technical Approach:
- Optimize the callback function in main.rs to improve state transitions
- Enhance timeout detection with better error recovery
- Improve coordination between frontend and backend state
- Document all core functionality for future maintenance

## [2024-09-18] - Enhanced Timeout Handling with Dedicated Action
Goal: Improve timeout handling with a specific action type

### Changes Made:
- Added `TimeoutIdleEmit` variant to the `PostEventAction` enum specifically for timeouts
- Modified the state thread timeout logic:
  - Kept the state reset to Idle
  - Kept clearing the timer flag
  - Set timeout_action to TimeoutIdleEmit instead of emitting directly
  - Added dedicated timeout action handling block
- Added catch-all in the process_hotkey_event function for safer debugging

### Technical Details:
- This approach separates the timeout UI notification from the state transition:
  - State is changed to Idle first
  - Then the dedicated TimeoutIdleEmit action is handled separately
  - Keeps timeouts from triggering audio recording operations
- The timeout is now handled consistently with other actions, maintaining code architecture
- Provides a clearer trace in logs when timeout events occur

### Impact:
- More consistent architecture for all state transitions
- Better separation of concerns between state changes and UI updates
- Improved debugging via the dedicated action type
- Enhanced log clarity for timeout scenarios

## [2024-07-17] - Implemented Improved State Machine for Recording
Goal: Revise the state machine to only start recording after confirming a Hold or Double-Tap.

### Problem Identified:
- Previous implementation started recording immediately on key press
- This caused unnecessary recordings for taps that didn't complete a gesture
- Created potential resource waste from starting/stopping recording frequently
- Made timeouts and state transitions more complex to handle

### Changes Made:
- Added new state enum variants:
  - `PressedWaitingForRelease`: Initial state after pressing key (replaces old `Recording` state)
  - `RecordingHold`: State for hold-to-record mode after confirming hold duration (renamed from `Recording`)
- Modified state transition flow:
  - Initial press: `Idle → PressedWaitingForRelease` (no recording starts)
  - Short release: `PressedWaitingForRelease → WaitingForSecondTap` (no recording starts)
  - Second tap press: `WaitingForSecondTap → LockedRecording` (recording starts)
  - Long press release: `PressedWaitingForRelease → RecordingHold` (recording starts)
  - Hold release: `RecordingHold → Transcribing` (recording stops)
  - Tap on locked: `LockedRecording → Transcribing` (recording stops)
- Updated timeout handling to not need recording stop (since no recording started yet)
- Updated frontend enum in types.ts to maintain compatibility

### Technical Details:
- Recording now only starts in two scenarios:
  1. After confirming a hold by releasing the key after TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS (entering RecordingHold)
  2. After confirming a double-tap by pressing the key a second time (entering LockedRecording)
- This is more efficient as recording is only started when a gesture is confirmed 
- WaitingForSecondTap timeout now just transitions to Idle without needing to stop a recording
- Frontend enum is simplified as the intermediate states (PressedWaitingForRelease, WaitingForSecondTap) don't need direct UI representation

### Impact:
- More resource-efficient - avoids starting/stopping recording unnecessarily
- Cleaner state transitions - each state has a clearer purpose
- Better separation between user input detection and recording actions
- Improved handling of timeouts and edge cases
- No orphaned recordings since recording only starts after confirmed gestures

### Next Steps:
- Monitor user feedback on the new interaction model
- Consider adding subtle UI feedback for the "waiting" states
- Fine-tune timing parameters (TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS, DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS)
- Add detailed analytics to measure key interaction patterns

## [2023-07-12] - Initial Architecture Setup
Goal: Create the foundation for the Fethr app

- Set up Tauri with React/TypeScript
- Implemented basic UI components
- Created HotkeyManager for global hotkey detection
- Established AudioManager for basic recording

## [2023-07-25] - Audio Processing Pipeline
Goal: Complete audio recording and processing workflow

- Added MediaRecorder integration for audio capture
- Implemented volume level monitoring via AnalyserNode
- Created audio visualization component
- Setup basic error handling for permissions

## [2023-09-05] - Transcription Integration
Goal: Connect audio recording with Whisper transcription

- Integrated Whisper.cpp for offline transcription
- Added format conversion pipeline (WebM to WAV)
- Implemented auto-paste functionality
- Created fallback UI for transcription review

## [2023-11-18] - AudioManager Debugging Enhancements
Goal: Improve robustness and debuggability of audio recording subsystem

- Added `lastRecordingTime` timestamp tracking to identify stalled callbacks
- Enhanced `setRecordingCompleteCallback` with comprehensive error handling and diagnostic logging
- Improved logging throughout recording lifecycle with emoji indicators for better visibility
- Added new diagnostic methods:
  - `getLastRecordingTime()` - Returns timestamp of last callback execution
  - `forceCallbackTrigger()` - Manually triggers recording callback for testing

### Technical Details
- Updated callback wrapping to provide detailed information about blob contents
- Added try/catch blocks around all callback executions to prevent silent failures
- Implemented timing measurements between recording stop and callback execution
- Enhanced log messages with type information and size reporting

### Impact
These changes significantly improve our ability to:
1. Debug audio recording issues that previously presented as "silent failures"
2. Identify timing problems in the recording pipeline
3. Trace the full lifecycle of an audio recording session
4. Recover gracefully from errors in user-provided callbacks

### Architecture Notes
The audio system in Fethr follows this flow:
1. User triggers recording via HotkeyManager
2. RecordingController coordinates state changes
3. AudioManager handles the actual recording via MediaRecorder
4. Recorded audio is processed through callbacks
5. Audio is sent to the Whisper service for transcription
6. Transcribed text is returned to the UI

NOTE: The enhanced logging is especially valuable on Windows where console access can be limited and timing issues are more common.

### Next Steps
- Add configurable audio quality settings
- Implement noise reduction capabilities
- Consider adding audio chunking for processing longer recordings

## [2024-09-18] - Simplified State Machine with Direct Tap-to-Lock
Goal: Simplify the state machine by removing the WaitingForSecondTap state and timeout logic

### Changes Made:
- Removed the `WaitingForSecondTap` variant from the `AppRecordingState` enum
- Removed the `FIRST_TAP_RELEASE_TIME` global and `DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS` constant
- Simplified the `PostEventAction` enum by removing timeout-related variants
- Replaced the `process_hotkey_event` function with a streamlined version:
  - Short tap now goes directly from Recording to LockedRecording
  - Removed all timer-based state transitions
- Simplified the state thread to use blocking `recv()` instead of timeout-based polling

### Technical Details:
- New simplified state flow:
  - Initial press: `Idle → Recording`
  - Short tap release: `Recording → LockedRecording` (immediate, no waiting)
  - Long press release: `Recording → Transcribing`
  - Tap while locked: `LockedRecording → Transcribing`
- This approach eliminates the intermediate waiting state and all timeout-related complexity
- Provides a more predictable user experience with immediate feedback

### Impact:
- Simplified codebase with fewer states and less complex logic
- Removed potential race conditions related to timeout detection
- More responsive UI as state changes happen immediately on user input
- Better maintainability with a more straightforward state machine implementation
- Reduced thread contention by eliminating the polling loop and associated locks

## [2024-09-18] - Fixed LockedRecording State Mapping in Frontend
Goal: Fix the state mapping for LockedRecording state in the React frontend

### Changes Made:
- Modified the state mapping in App.tsx to correctly handle "LOCKEDRECORDING" (without underscore) coming from the backend
- Changed case "LOCKED_RECORDING" to case "LOCKEDRECORDING" in the switch statement
- Added better error logging for unknown states and non-string state types

### Technical Details:
- The Rust backend emits "LOCKEDRECORDING" as a string (without underscore)
- The TypeScript frontend uses RecordingState.LOCKED_RECORDING enum (with underscore)
- The mismatch in naming conventions caused the LockedRecording state to be incorrectly mapped to IDLE
- Added detailed logging to help identify similar issues in the future

### Impact:
- Fixed the visual feedback in the UI when transitioning to LockedRecording state
- Ensures proper state transitions when tapping the hotkey
- Improves debugging capability with more detailed logging for state mapping errors

## [2024-09-18] - Improved Timer Logic in Frontend
Goal: Enhance the timer management in the React UI component

### Changes Made:
- Rewritten the timer logic in the PillPage component with a more precise implementation
- Added explicit variables `shouldBeRunning` and `isRunning` to improve code clarity
- Improved timer state management with better conditional checks
- Added safety mechanism to prevent memory leaks if startTime becomes null unexpectedly
- Preserved the timer display during transcription state

### Technical Details:
- The new approach is more declarative, using boolean variables for clear state representation
- Used more explicit condition checking: `shouldBeRunning && !isRunning` and `!shouldBeRunning && isRunning`
- Improved timer cleanup by ensuring interval reference is properly nullified
- Added specific behavior to keep duration visible during transcription state
- Preserved the standard display rules for Idle and Error states

### Impact:
- More robust timer management with fewer edge cases
- Clearer code makes maintenance easier
- Improves user experience by preserving duration during transcription
- Fixes potential memory leaks in timer interval management
- Provides better logging for debugging timer-related issues

## [2024-09-19] - Implemented "Single Tap Does Nothing" Functionality
Goal: Implement the ability for a single tap to effectively do nothing while preserving hold-to-record and double-tap-to-lock functionality

### Changes Made:
- Restored the `WaitingForSecondTap` state to the AppRecordingState enum
- Added back the `FIRST_TAP_RELEASE_TIME` global and `DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS` constant
- Updated `process_hotkey_event` to handle WaitingForSecondTap state transitions:
  - Short tap now goes to WaitingForSecondTap instead of directly to LockedRecording
  - Second tap during WaitingForSecondTap transitions to LockedRecording
- Implemented timeout detection logic in the state thread
- Added fallback re-emit mechanism to ensure UI updates properly after timeout
- Ensured StateUpdatePayload derives Default and Clone for simplified payload construction

### Technical Details:
- The implementation uses a clever approach where recording starts on initial press
- If a second tap doesn't occur within DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS (350ms), the recording is abandoned
- The frontend is updated to Idle state but no stop/transcribe event is triggered
- We added a fallback emit with a 150ms delay to ensure frontend state updates correctly
- This creates the user-facing impression that a single tap does nothing, while internally handling orphaned recordings

### Impact:
- Improved user experience with a more intuitive interaction model
- Users can now:
  1. Tap once to effectively do nothing
  2. Hold to record and immediately transcribe
  3. Double-tap to lock recording
- The implementation balances functionality with code maintainability

### Next Steps:
- Monitor performance implications of potentially abandoned recordings
- Consider improvements to resource handling for abandoned recordings
- Collect user feedback on the new interaction model

## [2024-09-19] - Added Safety Timeout Feature to Frontend
Goal: Implement a failsafe mechanism to prevent the UI from getting stuck in recording states

### Changes Made:
- Added a new `useEffect` hook in the PillPage component that monitors the current state
- Implemented a 5-second safety timeout for RECORDING and LOCKED_RECORDING states
- If the UI remains in these states for more than 5 seconds, it automatically resets to IDLE
- The safety reset also calls `signal_reset_complete` to ensure the backend state is synchronized

### Technical Details:
- The safety timeout only activates for states that should naturally transition (recording states)
- The timeout is cleared and recreated whenever the state changes, preventing false triggers
- Proper cleanup is implemented to avoid memory leaks when the component unmounts
- Detailed console warnings are displayed when the safety timeout is triggered to help with debugging

### Impact:
- Improves application reliability by preventing the UI from getting stuck
- Provides a failsafe mechanism for race conditions or edge cases in the state transitions
- Better user experience by ensuring the app recovers gracefully from unexpected conditions
- Helps diagnose potential issues by logging when timeouts are triggered

### Next Steps:
- Monitor the application logs to identify if the safety timeout is triggered frequently
- If frequent triggering occurs, investigate the underlying causes of state transition issues
- Consider adding analytics to track safety timeout occurrences for further optimization

## [2024-09-19] - Fixed Compilation Issues
Goal: Resolve compilation errors in the Rust backend

### Changes Made:
- Implemented the `Default` trait for `FrontendRecordingState` enum
  - Set `FrontendRecordingState::Idle` as the default value
- Removed unreachable catch-all pattern in `process_hotkey_event` function
  - The enum was fully covered by the existing match arms, making the catch-all unreachable

### Technical Details:
- The error occurred because we added `#[derive(Default)]` to `StateUpdatePayload` struct
- Since `StateUpdatePayload` contains a `FrontendRecordingState` field, that type also needs to implement `Default`
- The unreachable pattern warning occurred because all possible variants of `PostEventAction` were already covered

### Impact:
- Resolves compilation errors allowing the application to build and run
- Maintains the same functionality while improving code quality
- Sets a sensible default state (Idle) for the frontend recording state

## [2023-06-01] – Session Start: Configuration System Implementation

Goal: Implement a configuration system for the Fethr application to store and manage user settings.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Dependencies**
   - Added `directories = "5.0"` for finding standard config/data directories
   - Added `toml = "0.8"` for parsing TOML config files
   - Added `once_cell = "1.19"` for thread-safe singleton initialization

2. **Created Configuration Module (`src-tauri/src/config.rs`)**
   - Created `AppSettings` struct to hold configuration values:
     - `whisper_directory`: Path to Whisper installation
     - `whisper_model`: Name of the Whisper model file
     - `auto_paste`: Boolean flag to control auto-paste behavior
   - Implemented `SETTINGS` global variable using `Lazy<Mutex<AppSettings>>`
   - Added functions to load settings from a TOML file in the standard config directory
   - Added automatic creation of default config when none exists

3. **Updated Main Module (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)**
   - Added `mod config` and exported it for use by other modules
   - Modified `emit_stop_transcribe` to use the `auto_paste` setting from config
   - Updated the setup function to initialize the configuration system

4. **Updated Transcription Module (`src-tauri/src/transcription.rs`)**
   - Simplified `TranscriptionState` by removing hardcoded paths
   - Removed the `init_transcription` function that contained hardcoded paths
   - Modified `transcribe_local_audio_impl` to get paths from the config
   - Added proper handling of the `auto_paste` parameter

5. **Updated Audio Manager Module (`src-tauri/src/audio_manager_rs.rs`)**
   - Added import for the configuration system
   - Modified `stop_backend_recording` to respect both the parameter and config setting

### Next Steps:

1. Test the configuration system with different settings
2. Add UI controls in the settings window to modify the configuration
3. Consider adding more configuration options as needed

---

## [2023-06-01] – Bug Fixes for Configuration System

After implementing the configuration system, several bugs were identified and fixed:

1. **Added Default Implementation for TranscriptionStatus**
   - Added `impl Default for TranscriptionStatus` to provide a default value (Idle)
   - This was needed because TranscriptionState now derives Default

2. **Fixed Type Conversion in cleanup_files**
   - Updated calls to `cleanup_files` function to handle the type conversion:
     - Used `converted_wav_path_opt.as_ref().map(|v| &**v)` to convert `Option<&PathBuf>` to `Option<&Path>`
     - Added type hint `None::<&Path>` to disambiguate the None case

3. **Fixed Moved Value Issue**
   - Corrected code that attempted to use `output.stdout` after it was moved
   - Used the already-converted string `stdout_text` instead

4. **Addressed Non-binding Lock Warning**
   - Changed `let _ = config::SETTINGS.lock().unwrap()` to `drop(config::SETTINGS.lock().unwrap())`
   - This satisfies the Rust compiler's requirement for proper handling of mutex locks

5. **Added #[allow(dead_code)] for Utility Functions**
   - Added attributes to the utility functions that are retained for future use
   - This silences warnings about unused functions that we want to keep

All these fixes have resulted in a clean compilation with no warnings or errors.

---

## [2023-06-01] – Summary of Today's Work

Today I implemented a configuration management system for the application. The system uses the `directories` crate to find the standard configuration directory for the user's platform and stores settings in a TOML file in that location.

Key improvements:
- Created a standard location for configuration that follows platform conventions
- Eliminated hardcoded paths that were previously scattered throughout the codebase
- Made it possible for users to customize settings by editing the config file
- Simplified the codebase by centralizing configuration values

The implementation includes proper error handling and fallbacks to default values when the configuration file is missing or invalid. It also automatically creates a default configuration file with sensible defaults when none exists.

Next session will focus on creating a UI for modifying these settings directly from the application.

## [2024-09-26] - Implemented Bundled Resources for Whisper Integration
Goal: Modify the application to use Tauri's bundled resources for Whisper binary and models

### Changes Made:
1. Updated tauri.conf.json:
   - Added `externalBin` array with path to whisper.exe
   - Added `resources` array with path to models directory

2. Modified config.rs:
   - Removed `whisper_directory` field from `AppSettings` struct
   - Renamed `whisper_model` to `model_name` for clarity
   - Added `language` field for language selection
   - Updated default settings and loading/saving logic
   - Removed unnecessary configuration code related to directory paths

3. Updated transcription.rs:
   - Added Tauri's `resource_dir` import for path resolution
   - Replaced manual path construction with Tauri resource path resolution
   - Updated command execution to use bundled resources
   - Improved error messages and debug logging

### Technical Details:
- Resources are now bundled with the application using Tauri's resource and externalBin mechanisms
- Whisper binary is included as an external binary (vendor/whisper.exe)
- Model files are included as resources (vendor/models/*)
- Path resolution is now handled by Tauri's API instead of manual configuration
- User no longer needs to configure whisper_directory manually

### Impact:
- Simplified user setup - no manual configuration of Whisper directory required
- More reliable path resolution using Tauri's built-in APIs
- Cleaner configuration with only model name, language, and auto-paste options
- Consistent directory structure across all installations
- Improved error handling with more descriptive messages

### Next Steps:
- Test bundling on different platforms to ensure resource paths resolve correctly
- Consider adding a UI for selecting different model sizes
- Add support for additional languages beyond English

## [2024-07-18] - UI Component Library Update

Goal: Update the frontend to use shadcn/ui components

- Integrated shadcn/ui components into the project
- Replaced all placeholder component implementations in `SettingsPage.tsx` with proper shadcn/ui imports
- Updated the app structure to use `TooltipProvider` and shadcn's `Toaster` component
- Added proper TypeScript type annotations to fix type errors
- Maintained the existing dark theme styling with custom color values
- Enhanced component structure to match shadcn/ui's requirements (e.g., proper nesting of Select components)

This update brings several benefits:
- Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Consistent styling and behavior across components
- Better TypeScript integration with proper component typing
- Reduced code maintenance burden by using a well-maintained component library

Note: We're maintaining react-hot-toast for now as it's still used for notifications in multiple places, but will migrate to shadcn's toast system in a future update.

## [2024-07-18] - Enhanced Settings Page Data Fetching

Goal: Implement robust data fetching and saving for the Settings page

- Enhanced the data fetching logic in `SettingsPage.tsx`:
  - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
  - Implemented proper loading state management
  - Added detailed console logging for better debugging
  - Added validation to ensure received data is valid
  - Set sensible defaults for error cases

- Improved the settings saving functionality:
  - Enhanced error handling with more descriptive messages
  - Added truncation for long error messages in toast notifications
  - Included proper validation before saving attempts
  - Added detailed logging for successful saves and errors

- Refined UI state management:
  - Ensured UI elements are properly disabled during loading/saving operations
  - Disabled the Save button when no settings are available
  - Also disabled the About button during saving operations to prevent user confusion
  - Improved error display for both fatal and non-fatal errors

This implementation connects the frontend Settings page to the backend Tauri commands, allowing users to view and modify application settings, which are then persisted across application restarts.

## [2024-07-19] - Configured Vite Alias Resolution

Goal: Set up proper import alias resolution in Vite

- Updated `vite.config.ts` to support the `@/` import alias pattern:
  - Added import for the `path` module 
  - Added `resolve.alias` configuration to map `@` to the src directory
  - Configured Vite to properly watch files (ignoring src-tauri)

This change enables the use of absolute imports with the `@/` prefix (e.g., `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`), which makes imports cleaner and more maintainable. The configuration aligns Vite's path resolution with the TypeScript path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`.

Benefits:
- Eliminates the need for complex relative imports (../../..)
- Prevents import path breakage when files are moved
- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Resolves build errors when using shadcn/ui components

## [2024-07-19] - Improved Window Close Behavior

Goal: Prevent the settings window from closing permanently when user clicks the X button

- Added a window event handler in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` to intercept close requests:
  - Used the `.on_window_event()` handler in the Tauri builder chain
  - Checked if the event is for the "main" window (settings window)
  - When the close button is clicked, hide the window instead of closing it
  - Used `api.prevent_close()` to prevent the default close behavior
  - This ensures the window can be reopened later via the system tray icon

- Fixed Rust compiler warnings:
  - Removed unused import (`State`) from the top of the file
  - Prefixed unused function parameters with underscores in command handlers:
    - `_app_handle` in `get_settings`, `save_settings`, and `get_available_models`
  - Ensured consistent parameter usage across all functions

This improves the user experience by making the app behave like a proper system tray application, where the main window can be hidden and shown rather than closed permanently.

## [2024-07-19] - Configured Vite Alias Resolution

Goal: Set up proper import alias resolution in Vite

- Updated `vite.config.ts` to support the `@/` import alias pattern:
  - Added import for the `path` module 
  - Added `resolve.alias` configuration to map `@` to the src directory
  - Configured Vite to properly watch files (ignoring src-tauri)

This change enables the use of absolute imports with the `@/` prefix (e.g., `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`), which makes imports cleaner and more maintainable. The configuration aligns Vite's path resolution with the TypeScript path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`.

Benefits:
- Eliminates the need for complex relative imports (../../..)
- Prevents import path breakage when files are moved
- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Resolves build errors when using shadcn/ui components

## [2024-07-18] - Enhanced Settings Page Data Fetching

Goal: Implement robust data fetching and saving for the Settings page

- Enhanced the data fetching logic in `SettingsPage.tsx`:
  - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
  - Implemented proper loading state management
  - Added detailed console logging for better debugging
  - Added validation to ensure received data is valid
  - Set sensible defaults for error cases

- Improved the settings saving functionality:
  - Enhanced error handling with more descriptive messages
  - Added truncation for long error messages in toast notifications
  - Included proper validation before saving attempts
  - Added detailed logging for successful saves and errors

- Refined UI state management:
  - Ensured UI elements are properly disabled during loading/saving operations
  - Disabled the Save button when no settings are available
  - Also disabled the About button during saving operations to prevent user confusion
  - Improved error display for both fatal and non-fatal errors

This implementation connects the frontend Settings page to the backend Tauri commands, allowing users to view and modify application settings, which are then persisted across application restarts.

## [2024-07-18] - UI Component Library Update

Goal: Update the frontend to use shadcn/ui components

- Integrated shadcn/ui components into the project
- Replaced all placeholder component implementations in `SettingsPage.tsx` with proper shadcn/ui imports
- Updated the app structure to use `TooltipProvider` and shadcn's `Toaster` component
- Added proper TypeScript type annotations to fix type errors
- Maintained the existing dark theme styling with custom color values
- Enhanced component structure to match shadcn/ui's requirements (e.g., proper nesting of Select components)

This update brings several benefits:
- Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Consistent styling and behavior across components
- Better TypeScript integration with proper component typing
- Reduced code maintenance burden by using a well-maintained component library

Note: We're maintaining react-hot-toast for now as it's still used for notifications in multiple places, but will migrate to shadcn's toast system in a future update.

## [2024-07-20] - Improved Clipboard Behavior and System Tray Functionality

Goal: Enhance clipboard behavior and make system tray interaction more reliable

### Clipboard Improvements:
- Modified `stop_backend_recording` in `src-tauri/src/audio_manager_rs.rs`:
  - Always copy transcription text to clipboard, regardless of auto-paste setting
  - Separated clipboard copying and paste simulation for better control flow
  - User now always gets the transcription in clipboard, even when auto-paste is disabled
  - Fixed proper error handling to prevent cascading failures

### System Tray Enhancements:
- Simplified the tray click handler in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:
  - Removed the visibility toggle logic (show/hide) that was causing issues
  - Now always attempts to show and focus the main window on tray click
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Ensures consistent behavior when reopening the settings window

### Interface Improvements:
- Updated `paste_text_to_cursor` command:
  - Removed unnecessary text parameter since paste uses clipboard content
  - Improved function description and logging
  - Simulation now properly represents user workflow (copy then paste)

These changes improve user experience by ensuring transcription results are never lost and making system tray behavior more predictable and reliable.

## [2024-07-20] - Fixed FFmpeg Executable Path Resolution

Goal: Correct the FFmpeg executable filename to match the actual bundled filename on Windows

- Updated `run_ffmpeg_conversion` function in `src-tauri/src/transcription.rs`:
  - Added platform-specific FFmpeg executable name determination using conditional compilation
  - Used `ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` for Windows builds
  - Used `ffmpeg` for non-Windows builds (macOS, Linux)
  - Applied the correct filename in both debug and release modes
  - Improved error messaging when the executable is not found

- Updated `tauri.conf.json` to specify the correct FFmpeg executable in the `externalBin` array:
  - Changed `vendor/ffmpeg` to `vendor/ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  - This ensures the correct binary is bundled with the application on Windows

This change resolves an issue where audio conversion would fail on Windows because the code was looking for `ffmpeg.exe` but the actual bundled file was named `ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe`. The fix ensures proper audio resampling before passing to the Whisper transcription engine, improving transcription quality.

## [2023-09-20] - Whisper Auto Language Detection Implementation

Goal: Enable automatic language detection when the user selects "auto" language

- Modified `transcription.rs` to conditionally include the `-l` language argument:
  - When language is set to "auto" - omit the language flag entirely to enable Whisper's built-in detection
  - When language is specified - pass the language code as before
  - Added appropriate logging to track which mode is being used
  
- Technical details:
  - Whisper's native auto-detection works by omitting the language argument
  - The app now properly handles this configuration by checking language_string
  - Added empty language check as a fallback case
  
- Impact:
  - Users can now use automatic language detection by selecting "auto" in settings
  - Improves usability for multilingual environments
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging of language selection issues

TODO: 
- Consider adding a language detection result to the transcription output
- Test with multiple languages to ensure detection quality

## [2023-09-20] - Preventing Automatic Translation in Whisper

Goal: Ensure transcription occurs in the original spoken language without automatic translation to English

- Added `--task transcribe` argument to the Whisper command:
  - Unconditionally set the task to "transcribe" rather than the default "translate" when auto-detecting
  - Placed the task argument after language handling but before the `-nt` (no timestamps) flag
  - Ensures proper ordering of command-line arguments

- Technical details:
  - Whisper's default behavior is to translate non-English speech to English when auto-detecting language
  - The `--task transcribe` explicitly instructs Whisper to output in the source language
  - This works alongside the auto-detection feature implemented earlier

- Impact:
  - Multilingual transcriptions now remain in their original language
  - Prevents unintended translations when language is auto-detected
  - Provides a more accurate representation of the original speech

TODO:
- Consider adding a configuration option to allow users to choose between transcribe and translate modes
- Test with various languages to verify output is in the correct language

## [2023-09-20] - Fixed Whisper Command Arguments for Bundled Binary

Goal: Fix incompatible command-line arguments with the bundled Whisper executable

- Removed the `--task transcribe` argument added in previous update:
  - The bundled `whisper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` does not support the `--task` parameter
  - Runtime logs showed error messages when trying to use this argument
  - Restored the simpler command structure while keeping the language detection logic

- Technical details:
  - For this specific Whisper binary, transcription is already the default behavior
  - Translation would be enabled with the `-tr` or `--translate` flag, which we do not use
  - The correct approach is to simply not add any task-specific argument
  - Language selection/auto-detection works correctly without this parameter

- Impact:
  - Fixed error messages and ensured successful transcription
  - Maintained the auto-detection functionality introduced earlier
  - Simplified command structure to match the binary's expectations

TODO:
- Document the exact command-line interface supported by each bundled binary version
- Consider adding a translation mode option in the future using the correct flags
- Test with various languages to ensure correct mode is being used

## [2024-09-22] - Verified .env in .gitignore
Goal: Ensure the `.env` file containing sensitive Supabase credentials is not tracked by Git.

### Action Taken:
- Attempted to add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file.
- **Verification:** Read the existing `.gitignore` file and confirmed that `.env` was already listed under the `# Environment variables` section.

### Impact:
- Confirmed that the `.env` file is correctly ignored by Git, preventing accidental commitment of sensitive Supabase credentials to the version control repository.
- No changes were needed in `.gitignore`.

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with modifying `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` to use the environment variables defined in the (manually created) `.env` file.

## [2024-09-22] - Added Supabase Client Library
Goal: Add the Supabase JavaScript client library to the project dependencies.

### Changes Made:
- Executed `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.
- This adds the Supabase library to `node_modules` and updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Impact:
- Enables the frontend to interact with Supabase services (e.g., database, authentication).

### Next Steps:
- Configure Supabase client in the frontend.
- Implement features using Supabase (e.g., saving history, user accounts).

## [2024-09-22] - Created Supabase Client Utility
Goal: Create a reusable utility module to initialize the Supabase client.

### Changes Made:
- Created directory `src/lib`.
- Created file `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
- Added code to initialize the Supabase client using `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- Included placeholder variables for Supabase URL and Anon Key.
- Added basic validation to check if placeholders are still present.
- Configured Supabase client for session persistence using `localStorage`.
- Added console logs for initialization confirmation and validation errors.

### Impact:
- Provides a single, reusable instance of the Supabase client for the entire frontend.
- Simplifies Supabase integration in different components.

### TODO:
- **CRITICAL:** Replace placeholder URL and Anon Key with actual project credentials.
- Move Supabase URL and Anon Key to environment variables for security before production builds.

## [2024-09-22] - Initialized Supabase Client on App Load
Goal: Ensure the Supabase client initialization code runs when the application starts.

### Changes Made:
- Imported the `supabase` client instance from `@/lib/supabaseClient` into `src/App.tsx`.
- Added a `console.log` statement immediately after the import in `App.tsx` to verify that the module was loaded and the `supabase` instance exists.

### Impact:
- Importing the module at the top level of `App.tsx` guarantees that the client initialization logic within `supabaseClient.ts` is executed early in the application lifecycle.
- Makes the initialized `supabase` client readily available for use in other parts of the application that might be imported or rendered by `App.tsx`.

### Next Steps:
- Utilize the imported `supabase` client for authentication and data operations.

## [2024-09-22] - Implemented Supabase Auth State Management
Goal: Listen to Supabase authentication state changes and display user status in the settings.

### Changes Made:

**`src/App.tsx`:**
- Imported `useState`, `useEffect`, `Session`, `User` from React and Supabase.
- Added state variables (`session`, `user`, `loadingAuth`) to track authentication status.
- Implemented a `useEffect` hook:
    - Fetches the initial session using `supabase.auth.getSession()`.
    - Subscribes to authentication state changes using `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`.
    - Updates the `session`, `user`, and `loadingAuth` state based on the listener events.
    - Includes a cleanup function to unsubscribe the listener on component unmount.
- Passed `user` and `loadingAuth` state as props to the `SettingsPage` component route.

**`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`:**
- Imported the `User` type from Supabase and the `supabase` client.
- Updated the component props (`SettingsPageProps`) to accept `user` and `loadingAuth`.
- Updated the component function signature to receive the new props.
- Implemented conditional rendering for the "Account" section:
    - Displays a loading message while `loadingAuth` is true.
    - If `user` exists, displays the user's email and a "Log Out" button.
    - The "Log Out" button calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`.
    - If `user` is null, displays a message and a placeholder "Login / Sign Up" button.
- Added necessary imports (`Button`, `useToast`) for the new UI elements.

### Impact:
- The application now dynamically tracks the user's Supabase authentication state.
- The Settings page displays the current login status (loading, logged in, logged out).
- Users can log out using the button in the Account tab.
- Provides the foundation for implementing login/signup functionality and features requiring authentication.

### Next Steps:
- Implement the actual login/signup UI and logic (currently placeholder).
- Use the user state to control access to features or sync data (e.g., history).

## [2024-09-22] - Set Up Login/Signup Form Structure in Account Tab
Goal: Create the basic UI structure for login and signup forms within the Account tab of the Settings page.

### Changes Made:

**`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`:**
- Added a new state variable `authView` of type `'login' | 'signup'`, initialized to `'login'`.
- Modified the content of the "Account" tab for the logged-out state:
  - Replaced the previous single "Login / Sign Up" button with a new structure.
  - Implemented conditional rendering based on the `authView` state:
    - If `authView === 'login'`, a placeholder "Login" form area is displayed.
    - If `authView === 'signup'`, a placeholder "Sign Up" form area is displayed.
  - Each placeholder form area (`div` with border and background) includes:
    - A title (e.g., "Login" or "Sign Up").
    - Placeholder text for form inputs (e.g., "[Email Input Placeholder]").
    - A placeholder main action button (e.g., "Login" or "Sign Up").
    - A text paragraph with a link-styled button to switch to the other view (e.g., "Don't have an account? Sign Up" or "Already have an account? Login").
    - These toggle buttons update the `authView` state using `setAuthView`.
  - The signup form area also includes a small note: "(A confirmation email will be sent.)".
- Limited the width of the form container using `w-full max-w-sm` for better presentation.
- Ensured `Button` component is correctly used for form actions and view toggling.

### Impact:
- The "Account" tab now has a clear, user-friendly structure for handling both login and signup when the user is logged out.
- Users can easily switch between the login and signup views.
- Placeholder elements are in place, ready to be replaced with actual input fields and form submission logic.
- Provides a better user experience by separating login and signup flows visually.

### Next Steps:
- Implement the actual form input components (e.g., for email, password) within the placeholder areas.
- Add form validation and submission logic using the Supabase client for login and signup.

## [2024-09-22] - Simplified Account Tab to Login-Only View
Goal: Simplify the Account tab UI to only display a login form, removing the signup option and associated state.

### Changes Made:

**`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`:**
- Removed the `authView` state variable (`useState<'login' | 'signup'>`).
- Modified the content of the "Account" tab for the logged-out state:
  - Removed the conditional rendering logic that was based on `authView`.
  - The logged-out view now directly renders only the placeholder for a login form.
  - The placeholder signup form area was completely removed.
  - The link/button to toggle to a signup view (e.g., "Don't have an account? Sign Up") was removed from the login form area.
  - Updated the title within the login form area to "Login to Fethr".
  - Added a subtitle: "Use the account created on the website."

### Impact:
- The Account tab UI for logged-out users is now simpler, presenting only a login option.
- Removed complexity by eliminating the `authView` state and the conditional rendering for signup.
- Aligns with a user flow where account creation (signup) is expected to happen on a website, and the desktop app is primarily for logging in.

### Next Steps:
- Implement the actual login form input components and submission logic using the Supabase client.

## [2024-09-22] - Created and Integrated LoginForm Component
Goal: Implement a reusable Login Form component and integrate it into the Settings page Account tab.

### Changes Made:

**1. Created `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`:**
- Created a new React functional component `LoginForm`.
- Imported necessary dependencies: `React`, `useState`, `supabase` client, `Button`, `Input`, `Label` (from shadcn/ui), and `useToast`.
- Implemented component state for `email`, `password`, `loading`, and `message` (for form feedback).
- **`handleLogin` Function:**
  - Asynchronous function triggered on form submission.
  - Prevents default form submission.
  - Sets `loading` to `true` and clears any previous `message`.
  - Calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` with the provided email and password.
  - **Error Handling:** If login fails, logs the error and displays a destructive toast notification with the error message.
  - **Success Handling:** If login is successful, logs a success message. (Actual UI update to show logged-in state is handled by the `onAuthStateChange` listener in `App.tsx`).
  - Sets `loading` back to `false`.
- **Return JSX:**
  - Renders a `<form>` element with an `onSubmit` handler pointing to `handleLogin`.
  - Includes styled `Label` and `Input` fields for Email and Password.
    - Inputs are of type `email` and `password` respectively.
    - Values are bound to `email` and `password` state.
    - `onChange` handlers update the respective state variables.
    - Inputs are `required`.
    - Inputs are disabled when `loading` is true.
    - Inputs are styled to match the application theme.
  - Optionally displays a `message` paragraph (e.g., for non-toast feedback, though currently toast is used for errors).
  - Renders a submit `Button` that displays "Logging in..." when `loading` is true, and "Login" otherwise. The button is also disabled during loading.

**2. Integrated into `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`:**
- Imported the newly created `LoginForm` component: `import { LoginForm } from '@/components/LoginForm';`.
- In the Account tab's content (`activeSection === 'account'`), located the logged-out state (`!user && !loadingAuth`).
- Replaced the previous placeholder content (text and placeholder button) for the login form with the actual `<LoginForm />` component.
- Kept the existing title "Login to Fethr" above the `<LoginForm />` component.

### Impact:
- A dedicated, reusable `LoginForm` component now handles the login logic and UI.
- The Settings page's Account tab now displays a functional login form (using Supabase for authentication) when the user is logged out.
- Form includes input fields for email and password, a submit button with loading state, and error feedback via toast notifications.
- Code is better organized by separating the form logic into its own component.

### Next Steps:
- Thoroughly test the login functionality.
- Consider adding a "Forgot Password?" link/functionality if required.
- Style the `message` state display or remove if toasts are sufficient for all feedback.

## [2024-09-22] - Updated Supabase Client to Use Environment Variables
Goal: Read Supabase credentials from environment variables instead of hardcoding them.

### Changes Made:

**`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`:**
- Removed the hardcoded `const supabaseUrl = ...` and `const supabaseAnonKey = ...` declarations.
- Added lines to read these values from Vite's environment variables:
  ```typescript
  const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
  ```
- Added runtime validation checks:
  - Checks if `supabaseUrl` is missing and logs a styled error message to the console, instructing the developer to set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` in `.env`.
  - Checks if `supabaseAnonKey` is missing and logs a similar styled error message for `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Updated the `createClient` call to handle potentially undefined variables (though the validation should catch this in development):
  ```typescript
  export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl || '', supabaseAnonKey || '', { /* ...auth config... */ });
  ```
- Updated the confirmation log message to: `console.log('Supabase client initialized (using env vars).');`

**`src/vite-env.d.ts` (Created):**
- Created this new file to address TypeScript errors related to `import.meta.env`.
- Added a reference to `vite/client` types.
- Defined the `ImportMetaEnv` interface with `readonly` properties for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (both typed as `string`).
- Extended the global `ImportMeta` interface to include the `env` property typed as `ImportMetaEnv`.

### Impact:
- Supabase credentials (URL and Anon Key) are no longer hardcoded in the source code, improving security.
- The application now relies on the `.env` file (which should be gitignored) to provide these credentials at build/runtime.
- Added runtime checks to provide clear error messages during development if the `.env` file is missing or variables are not set correctly.
- Resolved TypeScript linter errors by providing type definitions for Vite's environment variables.

### Next Steps:
- Ensure the user has manually created the `.env` file in the project root and populated it with their actual Supabase URL and Anon Key.
- Restart the development server (`npm run tauri dev` or similar) to ensure the new environment variables are loaded by Vite.
- Verify successful Supabase client initialization by checking the console logs.

## [2024-09-22] - Implemented User Profile Fetching and Display
Goal: Fetch user-specific profile data (like subscription status) from Supabase and display it in the Account tab.

### Changes Made:

**`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`:**
- **Defined `UserProfile` Interface:** Added an interface `UserProfile` with expected fields (`id`, `email?`, `subscription_status?`).
- **Added Profile State:** Introduced state variables `profile` (type `UserProfile | null`) and `loadingProfile` (type `boolean`) using `useState`.
- **Created `fetchProfile` Function:**
  - Implemented an asynchronous function `fetchProfile` using `useCallback` to fetch data for a given `userId`.
  - Sets `loadingProfile` true, clears previous `profile`.
  - Uses the `supabase` client to query the `profiles` table.
  - Selects `id`, `email`, and `subscription_status` columns.
  - Filters the query using `.eq('id', userId)`.
  - Uses `.single()` to expect only one result.
  - **Error Handling:** Checks for Supabase errors (ignoring 406 status, which indicates no row found). Logs errors and displays a toast notification on failure.
  - **Data Handling:** If data is returned, updates the `profile` state.
  - **Fallback:** If no data is returned (status 406 or other), assumes a default profile (e.g., `{ id: userId, subscription_status: 'free' }`) to handle cases where the profile might not exist yet due to trigger delays.
  - Sets `loadingProfile` false in a `finally` block.
  - Added `toast` to the `useCallback` dependency array.
- **Triggered Profile Fetch with `useEffect`:**
  - Added a `useEffect` hook that depends on `user`, `fetchProfile`, and `profile`.
  - **Condition:** If `user` exists and the `profile` state is either null or belongs to a different user (`profile.id !== user.id`), it calls `fetchProfile(user.id)`.
  - **Logout Handling:** If `user` becomes null (logout), it clears the `profile` state by setting it to `null`.
- **Updated Account Tab UI (Logged-In State):**
  - Kept the display of the user's email (`user.email`).
  - Added conditional rendering based on `loadingProfile` to show a "Loading profile details..." message.
  - Added conditional rendering for when `!loadingProfile` and `profile` exists:
    - Displays the `Subscription:` status using `profile.subscription_status || 'Unknown'`. Added `capitalize` class for styling.
  - Added conditional rendering for when `!loadingProfile`, `!profile`, but `user` exists (fetch failed or data missing): Shows a fallback message "Could not load profile details. Try again later."
  - Kept the "Log Out" button.

### Impact:
- When a user logs in, the application now attempts to fetch their corresponding profile data from the `profiles` table in Supabase.
- The Account tab displays the user's subscription status (or a loading/error/fallback message).
- Separates auth user data (`user` prop from `supabase.auth`) from profile data (`profile` state from the `profiles` table).
- Handles cases where the profile might not exist yet for new users.

### Next Steps:
- Test profile fetching for both existing and newly created users.
- Implement the "Manage Subscription" button functionality (likely linking to an external page).
- Add more profile fields and display them as needed.

## [2024-09-27] - Temporarily Removed Audio Device Listing Feature
Goal: Isolate the persistent E0433 compilation error by temporarily removing all code related to the `get_audio_input_devices` command.

### Changes Made in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:

1.  **Deleted `AudioDevice` Struct:**
    *   Removed the entire struct definition for `AudioDevice`.

2.  **Deleted `get_audio_input_devices` Function:**
    *   Removed the entire function definition for `get_audio_input_devices`, including its `#[tauri::command]` attribute.

3.  **Removed Associated Imports:**
    *   Deleted the line `use cpal::traits::{DeviceTrait, HostTrait};`.
    *   (Note: `serde::Serialize` was kept as it's likely used by other parts of `main.rs`.)

4.  **Updated `invoke_handler`:**
    *   Removed the `get_audio_input_devices,` line from the command list within `tauri::generate_handler![]`.
    *   Reverted the `invoke_handler` structure by removing the extra pair of square brackets that were added speculatively in the previous step. The handler now uses the standard `tauri::generate_handler![command1, command2, ...]` format.

### Impact & Current Status:
- All code specific to the audio input device listing feature has been temporarily removed from `main.rs`.
- This should help determine if the E0433 error (`failed to resolve: could not find __cmd__...`) was directly caused by this feature or its registration.

### Next Steps:
- Re-compile the project (`npm run tauri dev`).
- **If compilation succeeds:** This strongly suggests the issue was with the `get_audio_input_devices` command or its interaction with the `tauri::generate_handler!` macro. The feature can be re-added carefully, perhaps by initially keeping it in `main.rs` and ensuring it compiles before moving it back to `audio_manager_rs.rs`.
- **If E0433 (or another error) persists:** The root cause lies elsewhere in `main.rs` or the build process, unrelated to the audio device listing command specifically.
