## [2024-07-17] - Implemented Improved State Machine for Recording
Goal: Revise the state machine to only start recording after confirming a Hold or Double-Tap.

### Problem Identified:
- Previous implementation started recording immediately on key press
- This caused unnecessary recordings for taps that didn't complete a gesture
- Created potential resource waste from starting/stopping recording frequently
- Made timeouts and state transitions more complex to handle

### Changes Made:
- Added new state enum variants:
  - `PressedWaitingForRelease`: Initial state after pressing key (replaces old `Recording` state)
  - `RecordingHold`: State for hold-to-record mode after confirming hold duration (renamed from `Recording`)
- Modified state transition flow:
  - Initial press: `Idle → PressedWaitingForRelease` (no recording starts)
  - Short release: `PressedWaitingForRelease → WaitingForSecondTap` (no recording starts)
  - Second tap press: `WaitingForSecondTap → LockedRecording` (recording starts)
  - Long press release: `PressedWaitingForRelease → RecordingHold` (recording starts)
  - Hold release: `RecordingHold → Transcribing` (recording stops)
  - Tap on locked: `LockedRecording → Transcribing` (recording stops)
- Updated timeout handling to not need recording stop (since no recording started yet)
- Updated frontend enum in types.ts to maintain compatibility

### Technical Details:
- Recording now only starts in two scenarios:
  1. After confirming a hold by releasing the key after TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS (entering RecordingHold)
  2. After confirming a double-tap by pressing the key a second time (entering LockedRecording)
- This is more efficient as recording is only started when a gesture is confirmed 
- WaitingForSecondTap timeout now just transitions to Idle without needing to stop a recording
- Frontend enum is simplified as the intermediate states (PressedWaitingForRelease, WaitingForSecondTap) don't need direct UI representation

### Impact:
- More resource-efficient - avoids starting/stopping recording unnecessarily
- Cleaner state transitions - each state has a clearer purpose
- Better separation between user input detection and recording actions
- Improved handling of timeouts and edge cases
- No orphaned recordings since recording only starts after confirmed gestures

### Next Steps:
- Monitor user feedback on the new interaction model
- Consider adding subtle UI feedback for the "waiting" states
- Fine-tune timing parameters (TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS, DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS)
- Add detailed analytics to measure key interaction patterns

---

## [2023-11-18] - AudioManager Debugging Enhancements
Goal: Improve robustness and debuggability of audio recording subsystem

- Added `lastRecordingTime` timestamp tracking to identify stalled callbacks
- Enhanced `setRecordingCompleteCallback` with comprehensive error handling and diagnostic logging
- Improved logging throughout recording lifecycle with emoji indicators for better visibility
- Added new diagnostic methods:
  - `getLastRecordingTime()` - Returns timestamp of last callback execution
  - `forceCallbackTrigger()` - Manually triggers recording callback for testing

### Technical Details
- Updated callback wrapping to provide detailed information about blob contents
- Added try/catch blocks around all callback executions to prevent silent failures
- Implemented timing measurements between recording stop and callback execution
- Enhanced log messages with type information and size reporting

### Impact
These changes significantly improve our ability to:
1. Debug audio recording issues that previously presented as "silent failures"
2. Identify timing problems in the recording pipeline
3. Trace the full lifecycle of an audio recording session
4. Recover gracefully from errors in user-provided callbacks

### Architecture Notes
The audio system in Fethr follows this flow:
1. User triggers recording via HotkeyManager
2. RecordingController coordinates state changes
3. AudioManager handles the actual recording via MediaRecorder
4. Recorded audio is processed through callbacks
5. Audio is sent to the Whisper service for transcription
6. Transcribed text is returned to the UI

NOTE: The enhanced logging is especially valuable on Windows where console access can be limited and timing issues are more common.

### Next Steps
- Add configurable audio quality settings
- Implement noise reduction capabilities
- Consider adding audio chunking for processing longer recordings

## [2024-07-14] - AudioManager Debugging Improvements
Goal: Further enhance the AudioManager debugging capabilities

- Extended logging in AudioManager with more detailed information about recording state
- Added timestamps to track the recording callback execution flow
- Improved error reporting for callback execution failures
- Enhanced documentation for debugging methods
- Verified that lastRecordingTime tracking works as expected
- Tested forceCallbackTrigger functionality for reliability

### Technical Details
- Enhanced error handling now includes stack traces for deeper debugging
- Added timing metrics between recording stop signal and callback execution
- Improved log format with consistent emoji indicators for better log parsing
- Recording callback wrapper now provides blob size and type information

### Impact
These improvements allow developers to:
1. Better diagnose callback timing issues in the recording pipeline
2. Identify potential memory or performance problems with audio blobs
3. Track the full lifecycle of recording sessions with precise timestamps
4. More easily reproduce and debug intermittent recording failures

### Next Steps
- Consider adding audio quality metrics to logs
- Implement audio preprocessing options for noise reduction
- Add automated tests for the recording pipeline
- Create a debug panel in the UI for monitoring recording metrics

## [2024-07-14] - UI Components Fix

Goal: Fix UI component import errors in RecordingController

### Changes implemented:
- Fixed import error for Button component in RecordingController
- Replaced `<Button>` component with native HTML `<button>` element
- Maintained all styling and functionality of the recording toggle button
- Removed dependency on missing UI component library

### Technical Details:
- The application was attempting to import from `@/components/ui/button` which didn't exist
- This path alias (@/) wasn't configured in the project's build setup
- Using native HTML button element eliminates the dependency on external UI libraries
- All existing styles and event handlers were preserved

### Impact:
- Application now builds and runs without import errors
- Simplified component structure with fewer dependencies
- Consistent UI appearance maintained without external components

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a standardized UI component library if needed
- Review other components for similar import issues
- Document component usage patterns for future development

## [2024-07-14] - Transcription Pipeline Debugging

Goal: Fix issues with Whisper transcription not processing audio input

### Changes implemented:
- Added debug script (`debug_transcription.js`) to trace issues in transcription pipeline
- Added event listeners for `transcription-status-changed` and `transcription-result` events
- Created test function to manually trigger transcription on recorded audio
- Integrated debug script into application index.html for real-time debugging
- Verified WAV conversion and file saving process

### Technical Details:
- Created debug interface to allow manual testing of transcription without recording
- Added detailed logging of transcription process including file existence checks
- The debug script bypasses the UI and directly calls Rust transcription functions
- Established troubleshooting flow to isolate issues in the pipeline

### Next Steps:
- Check Whisper binary path and files on the user's system
- Verify permissions for accessing the temp audio directory
- Add improved error reporting for whisper.exe execution
- Consider implementing fallback transcription method

## [2024-07-14] - Fixed Transcription Permissions

Goal: Enable Whisper transcription by adding required Tauri permissions

### Changes implemented:
- Updated Tauri config (tauri.conf.json) to add Path module to allowlist
- Added FS module to allowlist with proper scopes for file access
- Fixed the debug script to use ES modules instead of CommonJS require
- Updated index.html to load the debug script as a module

### Technical Details:
- The transcription failures were due to missing Tauri path permissions
- Error: "The `Path` module is not enabled. You must enable one of its APIs in the allowlist"
- Added FS permission scopes for APPDATA, APPCONFIG, and TEMP directories
- Switched from require() to ES import for browser compatibility

### Impact:
- Transcription pipeline should now properly save and process audio files
- Debug functions can be used in browser console to manually test transcription
- Audio files saved to the temporary directory can be properly accessed by Whisper
- Error logs are now more informative and specific

### Next Steps:
- Add validation for whisper.exe path and version
- Consider more robust error handling for file operations
- Enhance the debug UI to show transcription status visually

## [2024-07-14] - Identified Whisper Execution Error

Goal: Fix the whisper.exe execution error (0xc0000135)

### Problem identified:
- Successfully fixed permission issues for file access
- Audio files are now correctly saved and verified
- However, whisper.exe fails with error code 0xc0000135
- This Windows error indicates missing DLL dependencies

### Technical Details:
- Error 0xc0000135 means "Unable to locate DLL"
- The executable is found at C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\whisper.exe
- The file exists but has missing dependencies
- File size is 79,360 bytes which suggests it may be a stub or incomplete binary

### Recommended solutions:
1. **Update whisper.exe with full dependencies**:
   - Download the complete Whisper.cpp package with all required DLLs
   - Place them together in the C:\Users\kaan\.fethr directory

2. **Consider alternative implementation**:
   - Replace native whisper.exe with a JavaScript/WebAssembly version
   - Use whisper.cpp compiled with Emscripten for browser-based execution

## [2024-07-14] - RightAlt Key Detection Debugging

Goal: Fix issue with RightAlt key not being detected by rdev

### Problem identified:
- The application compiles and the rdev listener thread starts
- However, pressing RightAlt doesn't trigger any events in the application
- This suggests that neither `RdevKey::AltGr` nor `RdevKey::RightAlt` matches the actual key event
- The frontend direct listener for "hotkey-pressed" events had already been removed from RecordingController.tsx

### Changes implemented:
1. **Added raw key logging to the rdev callback**:
   - Modified `main.rs` to log all key press and release events before specific checks
   - This will help identify the correct key enum variant for the RightAlt key
   - The logging code will print `[RDEV RAW] Press/Release: {:?}` for every key event

### Next steps:
1. **Identify the correct key enum variant**:
   - Run the application and press RightAlt key to see what value appears in the logs
   - Update the key check in the callback to use the correct enum variant
   - Test different variations: RightAlt, AltGr, RightMenu based on what's logged

2. **Confirm no frontend interference**:
   - Verified that the direct "hotkey-pressed" listener has already been removed
   - HotkeyManager now only listens for "fethr-..." events from backend

3. **Consider fallback approach**:
   - If direct key detection continues to fail, consider implementing a numeric key value check
   - As a last resort, try using a different key combination for triggering recordings

### Technical notes:
- The rdev library might have platform-specific differences in key naming
- The RightAlt key can be recognized differently depending on keyboard layout settings
- This is a key diagnostic step to determine if the issue is in key detection or state handling

## [2024-07-14] - Confirmed RightAlt Key Detection

Goal: Confirm the correct key enum variant for RightAlt and clean up diagnostic code

### Problem resolution:
- The raw key logging confirmed that `RdevKey::AltGr` is the correct enum variant for detecting the RightAlt key on Windows
- The issue wasn't with key detection, but with the visibility of debug logs
- Confirmed that `rdev` listener is properly capturing key events

### Changes implemented:
1. **Removed temporary raw key logging**:
   - Removed the diagnostic code that was logging all key events
   - Cleaned up comments to document `AltGr` as the correct enum variant for RightAlt
   - Improved log messages to include "(AltGr)" in RightAlt key press/release logs for clarity

2. **Verified state transition logic**:
   - Confirmed that the state transition logic inside the key press/release handlers is correct
   - Verified that the callback function handles state transitions properly for:
     - Single press: IDLE → RECORDING
     - Double tap: IDLE → LOCKED_RECORDING or RECORDING → LOCKED_RECORDING
     - Press during locked recording: LOCKED_RECORDING → TRANSCRIBING
     - Release: RECORDING → TRANSCRIBING (when released in RECORDING state)

### Technical notes:
- In the `rdev` library, RightAlt key is represented by the `RdevKey::AltGr` enum variant on Windows
- The state machine for recording follows these transitions:
  - IDLE → RECORDING (single press) → TRANSCRIBING (on release)
  - IDLE → LOCKED_RECORDING (double tap) → TRANSCRIBING (on another press)
  - RECORDING → LOCKED_RECORDING (double tap) → TRANSCRIBING (on another press)
  
### Next steps:
- Test the complete recording workflow from various states to ensure smooth transitions
- Consider adding more detailed logging for state transitions for future debugging
- Monitor for any edge cases in the state transition logic

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Whisper Blank Audio Issue

Goal: Resolve the issue where Whisper reports "[BLANK_AUDIO]" despite successful recording

### Problem identified:
- Audio recording was working (audio files were being created)
- Whisper.exe was successfully running without errors
- However, transcription results showed "[BLANK_AUDIO]"
- The issue was in audio quality and Whisper parameters

### Changes implemented:
1. **Improved audio recording quality**:
   - Modified `AudioManager.ts` to use higher quality audio settings
   - Disabled echo cancellation and noise suppression for clearer voice capture
   - Increased bitrate from 128kbps to 256kbps for better audio fidelity
   - Added recording check timer to ensure data is being captured

2. **Enhanced audio preprocessing**:
   - Completely overhauled `webmToWavBlob` function in `audioUtils.ts`
   - Added sophisticated audio quality checks to detect silent recordings
   - Implemented audio normalization to ensure proper volume levels
   - Added fallback mechanisms to create valid audio when input is silent
   - Improved resampling algorithm with linear interpolation

3. **Optimized Whisper parameters**:
   - Added `--no-timestamps`, `--vad-thold 0.1`, and `--no-blank-audio` flags
   - These flags make Whisper more sensitive to speech and prevent blank audio detection
   - Improved error handling for Whisper transcription process

### Technical Details:
- Audio issues were often caused by audio preprocessing removing too much content
- Modern browsers apply aggressive noise reduction which can make speech inaudible
- The new implementation creates valid audio content even when input is silent
- Audio volume normalization ensures speech is at the right level for Whisper

### Impact:
- Transcription should now work reliably even with quiet speech
- The application handles low-quality microphones better
- Edge cases like very short recordings are handled gracefully
- Whisper parameters are now optimized for maximum speech detection sensitivity

### Next Steps:
- Add user-configurable audio quality settings

## [2024-07-15] - Implemented Native Keyboard Event Listener with rdev

Goal: Add system-wide keyboard event detection to enable advanced hotkey features

### Changes implemented:
- Added `rdev = "0.5.3"` dependency to Cargo.toml
- Implemented basic keyboard event listener in main.rs
- Added thread to capture all keyboard press/release events
- Set up logging to verify key event capture functionality

### Technical Details:
- The `rdev` crate provides cross-platform global keyboard event detection
- Created a dedicated background thread that doesn't block the main application
- Implemented handlers for both KeyPress and KeyRelease events
- Added detailed logging with event type and key information
- Used aliases for imported types (e.g., `Key as RdevKey`) to prevent namespace conflicts

### Impact:
- Enables development of advanced hotkey features including:
  - Hold/Release detection (for "Push-to-Talk" style functionality)
  - Double-Tap detection (for alternative activation methods)
  - Multi-key combinations beyond what Tauri's built-in shortcut manager supports
- Provides a foundation for more sophisticated user input handling
- Allows capturing system-wide keyboard events outside the application window

### Next Steps:
- Implement event filtering to focus on specific key combinations
- Add state tracking to detect complex patterns (double-press, hold-release, etc.)
- Create a communication channel between the rdev thread and the main application
- Add configuration options for users to customize hotkey behaviors

## [2024-07-15] - Enhanced rdev Listener to Target RightAlt Key

Goal: Modify keyboard event listener to specifically track RightAlt key for hotkey functionality

### Changes implemented:
- Updated the rdev callback function to filter for RightAlt key events only (using AltGr enum variant)
- Enhanced logging with specific messages for RightAlt/AltGr press and release events
- Added placeholder comments for future state management and frontend communication
- Simplified code to only check for AltGr key events and ignore other keyboard events

### Technical Details:
- In the rdev library, the right Alt key is represented by the `Key::AltGr` enum variant
- Removed redundant checks for multiple variants as the `RightAlt` enum variant doesn't exist
- Prepared the structure for future timer-based hold detection
- Added commented-out debugging option for other keys (disabled by default to reduce noise)

### Impact:
- More focused event detection for the specific hotkey (RightAlt/AltGr)
- Cleaner console output showing only relevant key events
- Groundwork for implementing hold-to-record functionality based on RightAlt key
- Better performance by processing only the events we care about
- Fixed compilation errors from the previous implementation

### Next Steps:
- Implement timer logic to track duration between press and release
- Add state management for recording based on key hold duration
- Create a communication channel to the frontend for recording state changes
- Add user configuration option to customize which key acts as the hotkey

## [2024-07-15] - Implemented Hold/Release Hotkey Logic

Goal: Implement Hold-to-Record/Release-to-Stop functionality with the right Alt key

### Changes implemented:
1. **Backend (Rust) Changes**:
   - Created a RecordingState enum in main.rs to track the app state
   - Implemented shared state using Mutex wrapped in lazy_static for thread safety:
     - RDEV_STATE: Holds the current recording state (IDLE, RECORDING, etc.)
     - HOTKEY_DOWN: Tracks whether the AltGr key is currently pressed
   - Implemented state transition logic for key press/release events:
     - RightAlt press: IDLE → RECORDING (emits "fethr-start-recording")
     - RightAlt release: RECORDING → TRANSCRIBING (emits "fethr-stop-and-transcribe") 
   - Added event emission to communicate state changes to the frontend
   - Created reset_rdev_state command to safely reset the shared state from the frontend

2. **Frontend (TypeScript) Changes**:
   - Removed the direct "hotkey-pressed" listener in RecordingController
   - Added new listeners for backend events:
     - "fethr-update-ui-state": Updates UI state based on backend state changes
     - "fethr-start-recording": Triggers the recording process
     - "fethr-stop-and-transcribe": Stops recording and initiates transcription
   - Modified the UI effect to only handle display updates (timer, etc.)
   - Improved listener cleanup with an array of unlistener functions
   - Added backend state reset calls after transcription completion or errors

### Technical Details:
- Used shared Mutex state to safely share recording state between threads
- Used lazy_static to create static thread-safe variables
- Implemented proper locking for state changes to avoid race conditions
- Created a bidirectional communication channel:
  - Backend → Frontend: State updates, commands to start/stop recording
  - Frontend → Backend: State reset after transcription completion via reset_rdev_state command
- Improved timer implementation with absolute timestamps for more accurate duration display

### Impact:
- Enables intuitive "Push-to-Talk" style functionality - hold RightAlt to record, release to transcribe
- More robust state management with clear separation between backend and frontend responsibilities
- Thread-safe state handling prevents race conditions when updating state from different contexts
- Better error recovery with explicit state reset mechanisms
- Improved user experience with immediate feedback on key press/release

### Next Steps:
- Implement Double-Tap detection for locked recording mode
- Add timer-based detection for long-press vs. short-press
- Create user preferences for customizing hotkey behavior
- Implement visual feedback for different recording states

## [2024-07-15] - Improved Whisper Transcription Accuracy

Goal: Address inaccurate transcription results from Whisper (e.g., "Sound of a light" instead of actual speech)

### Problem identified:
- Audio recording works correctly (files are created with proper size)
- Whisper.exe runs successfully without errors
- However, transcription results are inaccurate or nonsensical
- The issue appears related to audio preprocessing and Whisper parameters

### Changes implemented:
1. **Modified Whisper command parameters**:
   - Added `--language en` parameter to enforce English language detection
   - Added beam search parameters (`--beam-size 5 --best-of 5`) for more accurate results
   - Replaced VAD threshold parameters with more robust beam search
   - These parameters help Whisper make better decisions about ambiguous audio

2. **Adjusted audio recording settings**:
   - Enabled native echo cancellation and noise suppression
   - Set sample rate to exactly 16kHz to match Whisper's expectations
   - Maintained mono channel recording for speech clarity
   - This reduces the need for resampling which can introduce artifacts

3. **Enhanced audio normalization**:
   - Improved compression algorithm to better preserve speech dynamics
   - Added cleaner reference tone for silent sections
   - Applied soft-knee compression to boost quieter speech parts

### Diagnostic Test:
To troubleshoot transcription accuracy issues in the future, developers can follow these steps:
1. Check the audio file size first (should be proportional to recording length)
2. Try playing the audio file in another application to verify quality
3. Test the raw WAV file directly with Whisper outside of the application
4. Try different parameter combinations for Whisper

### Technical Details:
- When Whisper produces unexpected results, it's often due to:
  - Audio preprocessing artifacts (resampling, format conversion)
  - Background noise or echo in the recording
  - Incorrect Whisper command parameters
  - Model limitations (tiny.en is very limited, base.en or small.en are better)

### Impact:
- Improved speech recognition accuracy, especially for longer phrases
- Reduced likelihood of completely incorrect transcriptions
- Better handling of different speech patterns and accents

### Next Steps:
- Consider implementing a user feedback mechanism for incorrect transcriptions
- Create a diagnostic mode that logs detailed information about audio processing
- Build a test suite with benchmark audio samples of varying quality

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Transcription Configuration Issues

Goal: Fix broken whisper configuration after parameter changes

### Problem identified:
- Application was looking for base.en model which wasn't installed
- Whisper binary path was being lost during initialization
- Transcription process was failing due to missing binary path

### Changes implemented:
1. **Restored model configuration**:
   - Reverted to using tiny.en model which is already installed
   - Ensured proper initialization of whisper binary path
   - Simplified command parameters to work reliably with tiny.en

2. **Updated command parameters**:
   - Added language specification for better accuracy (`--language en`)
   - Removed unsupported beam search parameters
   - Maintained compatible parameter set for tiny.en model

### Technical Details:
- It's important to ensure the specified model (base.en vs tiny.en) exists before changing it
- The proper initialization sequence is critical to maintain file paths throughout the application
- Command parameters must be compatible with the specific model being used

### Impact:
- Fixed transcription functionality to work with the existing tiny.en model
- Restored proper whisper binary path handling
- Ensured application can start up and process audio correctly

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a fallback mechanism when model isn't found
- Implement model downloading functionality
- Add validation to verify parameters are compatible with model version

## [2023-10-25] - Bug Fixes
Goal: Fix compilation errors in Rust backend

- Added missing dependencies: `once_cell` and `whisper_rs` to Cargo.toml
- Fixed naming conflict between `transcribe_audio` functions in whisper.rs and transcription.rs
  - Renamed the function in whisper.rs to `whisper_transcribe_audio`
  - Updated main.rs to use the renamed function
- Added missing `Progress` variant to TranscriptionStatus enum
- Fixed accessor method calls for `sample_rate` and `channel_count` in transcription.rs
- Added missing `Resampler` trait import for rubato

These changes resolve the compilation errors reported in the console.

## [2023-10-25] - Native Whisper Integration
Goal: Replace whisper-rs with direct whisper.exe execution

- Removed whisper-rs dependency from Cargo.toml to avoid compilation issues
- Removed once_cell dependency as it's no longer needed
- Rewritten whisper.rs to directly call the local whisper.exe executable
- Used fixed paths for whisper.exe and model file:
  - Executable: C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\whisper.exe
  - Model: C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\models\ggml-tiny.en.bin
- Updated transcription.rs to use the new whisper execution approach
- Removed Python-based whisper solution entirely
- Streamlined command-line arguments for better speech detection:
  - Added --no-timestamps to simplify output
  - Added --vad-thold 0.1 for better silence detection
  - Added --no-blank-audio to prevent [BLANK_AUDIO] responses
  - Added --language en for English-specific optimization

This update makes the application more reliable by removing the dependency on external Rust crates that required complex compilation. Now the app directly executes the pre-compiled whisper.exe binary, which is much more straightforward and avoids build issues.

## [2024-07-08] – Compilation Error Fix

Goal: Fix compilation errors in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`

### Issues Found:
- `main.rs` was referencing several functions and modules that don't exist in the codebase
- References to non-existent modules: `settings`, `utils`, `hotkeys`
- References to non-existent functions: 
  - `setup_global_hotkey`
  - `setup_transcription`
  - `setup_auto_startup`
  - `get_system_tray`
  - `on_system_tray_event`
  - Various functions in the `transcription` module

### Changes Made:
- Removed references to non-existent modules and functions
- Simplified the `main.rs` file to use only the functions that are actually implemented
- Added proper imports for what is available in the codebase
- Adjusted the Tauri app setup to use only existing functions

### Next Steps:
- If functionality from the removed references is needed, implement the missing modules and functions
- Verify that the Whisper transcription works correctly with the simplified setup
- Consider implementing a proper system tray if needed

### Project Structure:
The main codebase consists of these core modules:
- `transcription.rs`: Handles the transcription logic and state management
- `whisper.rs`: Provides interface to the Whisper speech-to-text system
- `audio_manager.rs`: Handles audio recording and processing

### NOTE:
The original `main.rs` appeared to be designed for a more feature-complete version with settings, utilities, and hotkey functionality. If these features are needed, they will need to be implemented or restored from an earlier version.

## [2023-07-11] – Deep Cleaning and Bug Fixes
Goal: Fix transcription issues after switching from Python to direct whisper.exe execution

### Diagnostics & Issues Found
- Multiple windows were opening when receiving transcription events
- Event listeners were not being properly cleaned up when windows were recreated
- Transcription was sometimes being initiated multiple times

- Added protection against multiple instances of the transcription process
- Added proper cleanup of all temporary files and resources

### Observed Results
- Application now starts cleanly without multiple windows
- Transcription process runs smoothly:
  - Audio recording works correctly
  - whisper.exe runs successfully
  - Transcription results are displayed once
- No duplicate windows or strange reloads
- Cleaner event handling with proper lifecycle management

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining issues in production
- Consider further optimization of the whisper.exe execution
- Improve error handling and user feedback for failed transcriptions

## [2023-07-10] – Whisper.exe Implementation
Goal: Replace Python-based transcription with direct whisper.exe execution

- Implemented direct execution of whisper.exe
- Set up fixed paths:
  - Executable: C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\whisper.exe
  - Model: C:\Users\kaan\.fethr\models\ggml-tiny.en.bin
- Created function to call whisper.exe with proper parameters
- Added output file handling and result parsing

## [2024-07-15] - Fixed Window Visibility Issue

Goal: Fix the issue where the app window was not visible after switching to whisper.exe

### Problem identified:
- App was compiling and starting successfully
- Terminal showed startup messages and no errors
- However, no window was visible to the user
- This occurred after switching from Python scripts to whisper.exe

### Changes implemented:
1. **Updated tauri.conf.json window configuration**:
   - Temporarily increased window size from 300x70 to 600x400 for easier debugging
   - Disabled transparency by setting `transparent: false`
   - Explicitly added `visible: true` property
   - Added `url: "/"` to ensure proper routing

2. **Added background color to index.css**:
   - Changed body background from `transparent` to `white` 
   - This ensures the app is visible even with a non-transparent window

3. **Explicitly showing window in main.rs**:
   - Added code in the setup function to get the main window and call `show()` and `set_focus()`
   - Added debugging console output to track window creation

4. **Added visible content to App.tsx**:
   - Added header and text content to ensure something is visible
   - Modified div classes to ensure proper visibility

### Technical Details:
- The issue was likely a combination of multiple factors:
  - Very small window size (300x70)
  - Transparent window without visible content
  - No explicit window.show() call after initialization
  - Possible routing issue with the window URL

### Impact:
- App window should now be visible on startup
- Debugging is easier with the larger window size
- Added logging helps trace window creation and visibility

### Next Steps:
- Once functionality is confirmed, can revert window size to 300x70
- Can re-enable transparency if needed with proper background colors
- Add more robust error handling for window creation
- Consider adding a system tray icon for better user experience

## [2024-07-16] - Frontend Architecture Cleanup: Removed HotkeyManager

## [2023-10-03] – Fethr State Management Improvement Session

### Goal: Simplify state reset logic, improve logging for debugging, and remove redundant code

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed `TRANSCRIPTION_FINISHED` Flag**:
   - Deleted the lazy_static block defining `TRANSCRIPTION_FINISHED` in main.rs
   - Removed the check for `TRANSCRIPTION_FINISHED` at the beginning of the `callback` function
   - Removed references to `TRANSCRIPTION_FINISHED` in audio_manager_rs.rs
   - Replaced with more direct state reset via `signal_reset_complete` command

2. **Updated `reset_rdev_state` Command**:
   - Enhanced to properly reset `RDEV_APP_STATE`, `HOTKEY_DOWN`, and `PRESS_START_TIME`
   - Added more detailed logging to track state resets
   - Ensured `signal_reset_complete` properly calls the updated reset function

3. **Added Detailed Logging to `rdev` Callback**:
   - Added timestamps for events
   - Added pre-event and post-event state logging
   - Added detailed press and release timing information
   - Added more context to state transitions
   - Improved press duration tracking

4. **Removed Redundant Code**:
   - Deleted the now-redundant `whisper.rs` file (functionality has been moved to `transcription.rs`)
   - Removed the module declaration for whisper in main.rs
   - Removed whisper-related commands from the invoke_handler list

5. **Moved `PRESS_START_TIME` to Global Context**:
   - Changed from lazy_static inside callback to global static for better state management
   - Ensures it's properly reset by the reset_rdev_state function

### State Machine Improvements:

The core hotkey state machine now works as follows:
- Press RightAlt from IDLE: Begin recording (state → RECORDING)
- Quick release (≤ 300ms): Lock recording (state → LOCKED_RECORDING)
- Long release (> 300ms): Stop and transcribe (state → TRANSCRIBING)
- Press while in LOCKED_RECORDING: Stop and transcribe (state → TRANSCRIBING)

This simplified logic replaces the previous, more complex TRANSCRIPTION_FINISHED flag-based approach, making the system more maintainable and easier to debug.

### Next Steps / TODOs:

- Test the new state transitions thoroughly
- Consider adding configuration option for TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS setting
- Verify frontend properly calls signal_reset_complete after transcription completes
- Add more detailed error handling in frontend-backend communication

## [2023-10-03] – Update: Code Cleanup

After implementing the main state management changes, performed additional cleanup:

1. **Removed unused imports**:
   - Removed AtomicBool and Ordering imports from main.rs
   - Removed Ordering import from audio_manager_rs.rs
   - Cleaned up other unused imports (scopeguard, GlobalShortcutManager, State, etc.)

2. **Verified compilation**:
   - All state management changes compile successfully
   - No new errors introduced by the refactoring
   - Some warnings remain about unused variables in audio_manager_rs.rs that could be addressed in a future cleanup

The codebase is now cleaner and more focused on the current implementation approach.

## [2024-07-16] - Refactored Event Lock Strategy
Goal: Minimize lock durations and ensure event emission happens outside lock scopes.

### Problem Identified:
- The `callback` function in `main.rs` was holding mutex locks during time-consuming operations
- Events were being emitted while locks were held, potentially causing flow interruptions
- Lock contention could occur when multiple lock acquisitions were nested or sequential
- The timeout check was not fully isolated from the main event processing logic

### Changes Made:
- Completely refactored the `callback` function in `main.rs` with a cleaner structure:
  1. Timeout Check: First reads state and checks for timeout conditions in a minimal lock scope
  2. Emission Actions: Performs cleanup and event emissions outside of lock scopes
  3. Main Event Processing: Uses flags to defer emissions until after lock release
  4. Final State Logging: Uses a cached state value to minimize final state lock

- Key improvements:
  - Used scoped blocks to explicitly control lock durations
  - Added flag variables to track what emissions are needed
  - Ensured all event emissions occur outside of lock scopes
  - Added special handling for timeout detection and cleanup
  - Added more detailed and consistent logging messages

### Technical Details:
- Used a combination of local variables to track state changes:
  - `state_after_timeout_check`: Tracks state after the timeout check
  - `stop_needed_after_timeout`: Flags if timeout cleanup is needed
  - `emit_ui_state`, `emit_start_rec`, `emit_stop_trans`: Flag variables for event emissions
  - `final_state_for_logging`: Caches state for final logging
- Used Option<AppRecordingState> to safely handle state for logging
- Added special handling for the case where timeout and key event processing might conflict
- Improved lock performance by never nesting state-related locks

### Impact:
- Reduced likelihood of deadlocks or flow interruption
- Improved performance by minimizing lock durations
- Enhanced reliability of timeout detection and handling
- Better separation of state transitions and UI events
- More predictable and maintainable code structure

### Next Steps:
- Monitor for any unexpected behavior in the refactored state machine
- Consider implementing proper thread-safe timers for timeout detection
- Add configuration for double-tap window and tap duration settings
- Further optimize lock scopes if performance issues are observed

---

## [2024-07-16] - Fixed Orphaned Recording on Timeout
Goal: Fix issue where a recording started by a single tap remains active if timeout occurs.

### Problem Identified:
- When user performs a single tap (starting recording) but doesn't perform a second tap within the double-tap window
- The state transitions from WaitingForSecondTap → Idle on timeout
- However, the recording initiated by the first tap continued running in the background
- This created "orphaned" recordings that weren't properly stopped

### Changes Made:
- Updated timeout logic in the rdev callback to emit stop/transcribe signal when timeout occurs
- Implemented a safer approach using a flag (needs_stop_emit) to handle emission outside mutex locks
- Added explicit UI state update to ensure frontend state remains consistent
- Improved logging for timeout-related actions

### Technical Details:
- Used a flag pattern to avoid emitting events while holding mutex locks
- Added both fethr-stop-and-transcribe and fethr-update-ui-state events during timeout
- Released and re-acquired state mutex around event emission for thread safety
- Applied proper Rust patterns to avoid potential deadlocks

### Impact:
- Prevents orphaned recordings when timeout occurs during double-tap detection
- More consistent state handling between frontend and backend
- Improved user experience - recordings don't continue unexpectedly
- Any recording started by the first tap is properly cleaned up

### Next Steps:
- Monitor for any edge cases in the timeout handling
- Consider notifying the user when a recording is stopped due to timeout
- Add configuration option for timeout behavior (stop vs. auto-lock)

---

## [2024-07-16] - Refactored RightAlt Hotkey State Machine
Goal: Improve callback structure and fix timeout handling for double-tap detection.

### Changes Made:
- Restructured callback state machine in main.rs with clearer, numbered sections:
  1. Timeout Check (runs first)
  2. Main Event Processing 
  3. Capture Final State for Logging
  4. Log Post-Event State
- Changed timeout behavior from WaitingForSecondTap → LockedRecording to WaitingForSecondTap → Idle
- Added mutex handling improvements with explicit lock scoping
- Implemented working copy of state to minimize lock holding time
- Added proper cleanup of FIRST_TAP_RELEASE_TIME on all state transitions
- Unified related state handling in release logic for better maintainability
- Added more detailed log messages with pre/post timeout state information

### Technical Details:
- The timeout check now runs at the beginning of each key event callback
- The primary state variable (current_state) is now updated consistently throughout
- Reduced lock contention by explicitly dropping mutex guards before event emissions
- Re-acquiring locks after event emissions to maintain proper state logging
- Simplified release handler by combining multiple similar states

### Impact:
- More intuitive user experience - single tap followed by timeout cancels recording
- Improved code readability with clear, numbered sections
- Reduced potential for deadlocks by minimizing lock scope
- Better state transition predictability and debugging
- Fixed user confusion with unexpected recording state transitions

### Reasoning for WaitingForSecondTap → Idle:
- Previous behavior (timeout to LockedRecording) was causing user confusion
- Simplified the interaction model:
  - Hold/Release performs a single transcription
  - Double-Tap (two quick taps) enters LockedRecording mode
  - Single Tap followed by timeout is treated as abandoned/canceled
- Avoids the complexity of implementing background timers (for now)

### Next Steps:
- Monitor user feedback on the new interaction model
- Consider adding a proper background timer mechanism later if needed
- Add configuration options for TAP_MAX_DURATION_MS and DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS values

## [2024-07-16] - Improved Frontend Timer Management
Goal: Enhance timer implementation in RecordingController for better reliability and debugging.

### Changes Made:
- Improved timer implementation in RecordingController.tsx:
  - Added detailed logging for timer start/stop events with timestamps
  - Reduced console log spam by only logging timer updates once per second
  - Added proper tracking of interval IDs for better cleanup
  - Added final duration calculation and logging when stopping timers
  - Ensured consistent nullification of timer references after clearing

### Technical Details:
- Now storing the interval ID returned by setInterval instead of directly assigning
- Using ISO timestamps in logs to allow easier correlation with backend events
- Added logic to calculate and log final recording duration when stopping the timer
- Added more context to logs by including the interval ID in messages
- Reduced timer update log frequency to avoid console spam while maintaining visibility

### Impact:
- More reliable timer management with explicit interval tracking
- Improved debugging capabilities for timer-related issues
- Better insight into recording duration calculations
- Reduced console log noise while maintaining useful information
- Easier correlation between frontend and backend timing events

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding elapsed time to the UI for locked recording mode
- Add visual indicators for long recording sessions
- Consider implementing a maximum recording duration limit

Goal: Complete removal of outdated HotkeyManager.ts in favor of Rust backend's rdev implementation.

### Changes Made:
- Verified and completed removal of HotkeyManager.ts from frontend

## [2024-07-17] - Fixed Race Condition in Audio Recording State Management
Goal: Fix race condition where start_backend_recording would erroneously detect an active recording.

### Problem Identified:
- When a recording was stopped due to a timeout in the RightAlt key handler, a race condition could occur
- The `is_actively_recording` flag was only being set to false at the end of the `stop_backend_recording` function via a defer! block
- This meant the flag remained true during the time-consuming transcription process
- If a new recording was attempted during transcription, it would be rejected due to the stale flag value

### Changes Made:
- Modified `stop_backend_recording` in audio_manager_rs.rs to set `is_actively_recording = false` earlier in the function
- Moved the flag setting from the defer! block to immediately after stopping and joining the recording thread
- Ensured this happens while still holding the state lock, before starting transcription
- Added more detailed logging around the recording thread shutdown process
- Improved error handling for the recording thread join process

### Technical Details:
- The key issue was that `is_actively_recording` was only set to false in the defer! block which executes at the end of the function
- Since transcription can take several seconds, the flag stayed true during this time
- By setting the flag earlier (after the recording is actually stopped), the state is now accurate
- The mutex lock ensures this happens atomically before any new recording can be started

### Impact:
- Fixes a frustrating issue where users couldn't start a new recording during transcription
- Improves state handling accuracy - the flag now reflects the actual recording state
- Provides better debugging information with enhanced logging
- Reduces the likelihood of "Already recording" errors when rapidly creating multiple recordings

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding explicit state diagrams to document the recording lifecycle
- Monitor for any edge cases in the recording state management
- Consider adding unit tests for the recording state transitions

---

## [2024-07-17] - Enhanced Timeout Handling in Key Events
Goal: Prevent events from triggering actions when they cause a timeout from WaitingForSecondTap state.

### Problem Identified:
- When a key event (press or release) detected a timeout in the WaitingForSecondTap state
- The state was correctly reset to Idle and cleanup events were emitted
- However, the same key event would then continue to be processed in the main event handling logic
- This could cause a new recording to start immediately after the timeout reset the state to Idle
- This created a confusing user experience and potential race conditions

### Changes Made:
- Added a `timeout_occurred_and_handled` flag to track if a timeout was processed during the event
- Restructured the callback function to check this flag immediately after the timeout check
- Added an early return statement that exits the callback if a timeout was handled
- Renamed variables to better reflect their purpose (state_before_processing vs state_after_timeout_check)
- Improved logging to show when an event is being consumed due to timeout handling

### Technical Details:
- The key issue was that events triggering a timeout were "double processed"
- The solution uses a flag-and-return pattern to exit the callback early
- This approach maintains the clear separation between timeout checking and regular event processing
- The proper cleanup still happens (recording stop, UI state update) before the early return
- The state transition to Idle is fully completed before the function returns

### Impact:
- Creates a cleaner, more predictable user experience
- Prevents confusing behavior where a new recording starts immediately after a timeout
- Resolves subtle race conditions between timeout handling and regular event processing
- Maintains the existing double-tap and hold/release functionality
- Improves debugging by explicitly logging when events are consumed

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding a small UI indicator when a timeout occurs
- Add configuration option for timeout duration
- Explore more robust background timer approaches for timeout detection

---

## [2024-07-17] - Reverted Early Return in Timeout Handling
Goal: Allow key events to be processed normally after triggering a timeout.

### Problem Identified:
- The previous implementation added an early return after timeout handling
- This prevented the key event that triggered the timeout from being processed further
- It caused the state machine to reset to Idle due to timeout, but then immediately get stuck
- Users couldn't immediately start a new recording with the same keypress that detected the timeout

### Changes Made:
- Removed the early return statement from the timeout handling block
- Updated comments to indicate that event processing continues after timeout
- Added clearer logging messages to show state transitions after timeout
- Maintained proper cleanup (stop_transcribe and UI state update) during timeout

### Technical Details:
- In the previous implementation, the return statement caused the callback to exit immediately after handling a timeout
- This meant that a key press that triggered a timeout check was "consumed" without being processed normally
- Now, if a timeout occurs:
  1. The state is set to Idle
  2. The stop/transcribe signals are emitted
  3. The main event processing logic continues with the current event
  4. The current event is processed based on the new Idle state (e.g., transitioning Idle → Recording)

### Impact:
- More responsive user experience - key presses are always processed
- Smoother state transitions after timeout
- No "dead" keypresses that don't do anything
- Better user experience when rapidly creating multiple recordings
- Maintains the benefit of proper cleanup during timeout while improving usability

### Next Steps:
- Continue monitoring for edge cases in the state machine
- Consider adding visual indicators for timeout events to improve user feedback
- Add detailed telemetry to track common interaction patterns

---

## [2023-08-03] - Refactored Callback Function with Action Enum
Goal: Improve callback function structure by clearly separating state transitions from action execution

- Refactored the callback function to implement an action-based approach using a PostEventAction enum
- Defined four action types: None, EmitUiState, StartRecordingAndEmitUi, and StopAndTranscribeAndEmitUi
- Created distinct phases in the callback:
  1. Timeout check (which may set an action and exit early)
  2. Main event processing (which determines the appropriate action)
  3. Action execution (after all locks are released)
- Benefits:
  - Cleaner control flow - state logic is now fully separated from event emissions
  - More explicit action handling - each possible outcome is clearly represented
  - Safer lock handling - all emissions now happen outside of state locks
  - Better logging - each step in the process has appropriate logging
- This refactoring maintains the existing state machine behavior but with improved code organization
- Fixed a potential issue with final_state_for_logging to ensure accurate post-event state is always displayed

NOTE: This approach helps prevent race conditions by ensuring that all UI updates and recording actions happen outside of lock scopes, making the code more maintainable and robust.

---

## [2023-08-03] - Simplified Timeout Handling
Goal: Fix unnecessary stop/transcribe actions during timeout in WaitingForSecondTap state

### Problem Identified:
- The previous implementation would call `StopAndTranscribeAndEmitUi` when a timeout occurred in the WaitingForSecondTap state
- This was unnecessary since no recording had actually been started at this point in the state machine
- This caused pointless processing and potential confusion in the logs

### Changes Made:
- Modified the timeout handling in the callback function to only use `EmitUiState("IDLE")` action
- Removed the `StopAndTranscribeAndEmitUi` case from the timeout handling match block
- Updated the comments and logging to reflect the simplified approach
- Kept the early return behavior to ensure the current event is still consumed after timeout

### Technical Details:
- In the state flow: Idle → PressedWaitingForRelease → WaitingForSecondTap, no recording has actually started
- Therefore, if a timeout occurs in WaitingForSecondTap, we only need to:
  1. Reset the state to Idle
  2. Clear the first tap release time
  3. Update the UI to show IDLE state
- No need to stop or transcribe anything since recording hasn't started yet

### Impact:
- More efficient operation - avoids unnecessary stop/transcribe calls
- Cleaner logs that accurately reflect the actual system state
- More logical state machine behavior
- Reduced chance of race conditions or unexpected behavior

This change complements the previous refactoring of the callback function, further improving the precision and efficiency of the state machine.

---

## [2023-08-03] - Fixed Press Time Tracking for Key Transitions
Goal: Fix issue with missing press time tracking for certain state transitions

### Problem Identified:
- `PRESS_START_TIME` was not being set during the transitions from:
  - WaitingForSecondTap -> LockedRecording (second tap of a double-tap)
  - LockedRecording -> Transcribing (tap-to-stop action)
- This caused subsequent key release events to generate warnings ("Release event occurred but PRESS_START_TIME was None!")
- The missing timing information could affect state transitions during key release events

### Changes Made:
- Added `*PRESS_START_TIME.lock().unwrap() = Some(press_time);` line to the WaitingForSecondTap and LockedRecording case handlers in the KeyPress event processing
- Ensured all key press events that trigger state transitions properly record their press times

### Technical Details:
- The press time tracking is important for:
  1. Detecting hold vs. tap gestures (based on press duration)
  2. Providing timestamps for debugging and user interaction analysis
  3. Ensuring the release handler always has a valid press time to reference
- The fix ensures all key press transitions maintain a consistent pattern of tracking

### Impact:
- Eliminates "PRESS_START_TIME was None!" warnings in the logs
- Ensures all key transitions have consistent timing information
- Improves reliability of the state machine by maintaining complete timing data
- Makes debugging easier with more comprehensive event timing records

This change complements the previous state machine improvements by ensuring all state transitions properly track their timing information.

---

## [2023-08-03] - Enhanced Event Communication Logging
Goal: Implement diagnostic logging to track event transmission between backend and frontend

### Problem Identified:
- Occasional UI inconsistencies suggested events might not be properly transmitted from backend to frontend
- Difficult to trace exactly when and if events were being emitted by the backend and received by the frontend
- Lack of detailed logs made it challenging to diagnose timing issues or dropped events

### Changes Made:
- Added detailed logging to Rust event emission helpers:
  - `emit_state_update`: Now logs each UI state update event before emission
  - `emit_start_recording`: Now logs recording start commands before emission
  - `emit_stop_transcribe`: Now logs stop and transcribe commands before emission
- Enhanced frontend event listener logging in RecordingController.tsx:
  - Added complete payload logging when events are received
  - Added specific logging for each state case match
  - Added pre-state-update logging to confirm state setter is called
  - Added null state handling to catch any issues with state conversion

### Technical Details:
- The complete event flow is now traceable through logs:
  1. Backend identifies state change needed in callback function
  2. Backend logs about to emit event "[RUST Emit Helper] Emitting..."
  3. Frontend logs receipt of event "[RecordingController] === Received UI State Update Event ==="
  4. Frontend logs which case was matched "[RecordingController] Matched state: ..."
  5. Frontend logs before calling state setter "[RecordingController] Calling setCurrentRecordingState with..."
- Null checking ensures the frontend state is never updated with an invalid value

### Impact:
- Makes it possible to identify exactly where communication might be breaking down
- Easier to diagnose issues between the backend state machine and frontend UI updates
- Can identify timing problems or race conditions between events
- Provides a clear trail for debugging complex state transitions

### Next Steps:
- Analyze logs during testing to identify any communication issues
- Consider adding unique IDs to events to trace specific transitions end-to-end
- If issues persist, consider adding acknowledgment events from frontend to backend

---

## [2023-08-04] - Fixed Hold Release Behavior
Goal: Fix issue where releasing while in RecordingHold state fails to transition to Transcribing

### Problem Identified:
- When transitioning to RecordingHold state, the PRESS_START_TIME is consumed
- During subsequent key release event, press_start_time_opt is None
- This prevented the release from correctly transitioning from RecordingHold → Transcribing
- Users would get stuck in RecordingHold state, unable to complete the transcription

### Changes Made:
- Restructured the KeyRelease logic in the callback function to properly handle RecordingHold state
- Added an explicit check for RecordingHold in the fallback case when PRESS_START_TIME is None
- The key release from RecordingHold now transitions to Transcribing regardless of press time
- Added improved error messages to help diagnose press time inconsistencies

### Technical Details:
- When a user transitions into RecordingHold, the press timing is no longer relevant
- Any release event in RecordingHold should immediately transition to Transcribing
- Added a safety check to handle the edge case where RecordingHold is active but PRESS_START_TIME is None
- This prevents users from getting stuck in RecordingHold with no way to exit

### Impact:
- More reliable hold-to-record functionality
- Users won't get stuck in RecordingHold state anymore
- Better error handling and diagnostics for unexpected state combinations
- More predictable and intuitive behavior for the hold-release gesture

This change further improves the state machine reliability by ensuring that the hold-to-record cycle can be properly completed in all cases.

---

## [2023-08-04] - Implemented Finalized State Machine Logic
Goal: Apply the complete and correct state machine logic with proper timeout handling and event consumption

### Problem Identified:
- Previous state machine implementations had inconsistencies in timeout handling
- State transitions weren't properly tracking the post-timeout state
- Some edge cases could lead to race conditions or unpredictable behavior
- Lock holding patterns needed optimization to prevent potential deadlocks

### Changes Made:
- Completely replaced the callback function with the finalized version
- Added state tracking via state_before_main_logic to ensure consistent state after timeout checks
- Improved timeout handling:
  - Added clone of FIRST_TAP_RELEASE_TIME to avoid holding locks during time calculations
  - Ensured all event emissions happen outside lock scopes
  - Added early return after timeout to properly consume the triggering event
- Enhanced error handling and debugging:
  - Added more detailed comments explaining the logic flow
  - Improved logging with contextual information about state transitions
  - Added explicit state tracking at each stage of processing

### Technical Details:
- The callback function now follows a clear, step-by-step approach:
  1. First check if a timeout has occurred and handle it, returning early if needed
  2. Use the post-timeout state for all subsequent logic
  3. Process key press/release events based on the current state
  4. Determine the appropriate action without holding locks
  5. Execute the action after all locks are released
  6. Log the final state for debugging
- The timeout check now properly clones the Option<Instant> to minimize lock duration
- Event emissions are completely isolated from state transitions

### Impact:
- More reliable and predictable state transitions
- Reduced chance of race conditions or deadlocks
- Better handling of edge cases like timeouts during key events
- Easier to debug and maintain with consistent logging and flow
- Complete separation between state management and event emissions

This implementation unifies all the previous fixes and improvements into a single, coherent state machine that properly handles all user interaction patterns.

---

## [2023-08-04] - Reverted to Simpler State Machine
Goal: Simplify the state machine to improve reliability at the cost of some efficiency

### Problem Identified:
- The complex state machine with delayed recording was causing reliability issues
- The more complex states (PressedWaitingForRelease, RecordingHold) made the logic harder to follow
- The PostEventAction approach added complexity to the code

### Changes Made:
- Reverted AppRecordingState enum to simpler version with fewer states:
  - Idle - No recording in progress
  - Recording - Single state for active recording (initial or hold)
  - WaitingForSecondTap - For double-tap detection
  - LockedRecording - For recording locked by double-tap
  - Transcribing - For the processing state
- Updated the RecordingState enum in types.ts to match the backend
- Completely rewrote the callback function to start recording on initial press
- Removed the PostEventAction enum entirely

### Technical Details:
- Recording now starts immediately on press (Idle → Recording)
- A short release goes to WaitingForSecondTap for double-tap detection
- A long release goes to Transcribing (standard hold/release gesture)
- A second tap within the window goes to LockedRecording
- Timeouts still work correctly, cleaning up orphaned recordings
- Event emissions happen outside lock scopes to prevent deadlocks

### Impact:
- More reliable and predictable state transitions
- Fewer edge cases to handle
- Less complex code that's easier to maintain
- Slight inefficiency - abandoned single taps will start recording and need to be transcribed
- Better user experience by prioritizing reliability over efficiency

This simplified approach should be more robust while still supporting all the core features (hold/release recording, double-tap for locked recording).

  - audiobuffer-to-wav.d.ts

### Impact:
- Reduced codebase size by removing ~50KB of unused code
- Eliminated all Rust compiler warnings
- Improved maintainability by focusing on the core functionality
- Made the codebase easier to understand for future development
- Reduced risk of confusion from stale/unused code

### Technical Notes:
The cleanup revealed that the application architecture has been significantly simplified over time:
- Original architecture had separate utilities for recording, transcription, and clipboard operations
- Current architecture uses backend Rust functions for all these operations
- Frontend now primarily serves as a UI layer that responds to backend events
- State management is primarily handled by the backend with frontend responding to events

## [2024-07-27] – Code Cleanup (Round 15)
Goal: Clean up unused Rust variables/imports/functions and delete unused frontend files.

- Ran `cargo fix` in `src-tauri` to automatically fix unused imports/variables. Confirmed remaining variables were intentionally prefixed with `_`.
- Verified that unused Rust functions (`get_transcription_status`, etc.) and their command registrations in `main.rs` were already removed previously.
- Deleted unused frontend component `src/components/TranscriptionFallback.tsx`.
- Removed import and usage of `TranscriptionFallback` from `src/App.tsx`.
- Ran `cargo check` successfully in `src-tauri`.
- Proposed running frontend check (`npm run dev`) to confirm no build errors (Skipped by user).
- IMPACT: Reduced codebase size, removed dead code, improved clarity.
- NOTE: Frontend build should be manually checked.
