# Final Filler Removal Status

## What's Working Well ‚úÖ

### Filler Removal:
- **Basic fillers**: "um", "uh", "ah" - always removed
- **Sentence starters**: "So", "Well", "Actually" - removed at start
- **Filler phrases with commas**: "you know,", "I mean," - removed when followed by comma
- **Protection**: Meaningful phrases like "you know what I mean" are preserved

### Conservative Approach Benefits:
- No false positives observed in testing
- Users can control removal by adding pauses (which create commas)
- Safe for professional use

## Known Limitations üìù

### 1. Punctuation After "I mean," Removal
- When removing "I mean,", we lose sentence boundaries
- Example: "important. I mean, we've working" ‚Üí "important we've working"
- **Workaround**: Users can pause longer to create clearer sentence breaks

### 2. Requires Commas for Phrase Removal  
- "you know" without comma won't be removed
- This is intentional to prevent breaking "you know the answer"
- **Workaround**: Pause after saying "you know" to add comma

### 3. "Like" as Filler
- Only removed in specific contexts or with comma
- Most instances of "like" are preserved
- **Workaround**: Avoid using "like" as a filler

## Usage Tips for Best Results

1. **Pause for Commas**: Say "you know... (pause) really important"
2. **Clear Sentence Breaks**: Pause between sentences
3. **Natural Speech**: The system works best with natural pauses
4. **Edit After**: Minor edits may be needed for perfect punctuation

## Technical Summary

The filler removal system is working as designed with a conservative approach that prioritizes preserving meaning over aggressive removal. The regex fix ensures protected phrases work correctly, though they weren't needed in practice due to our conservative patterns.

This is a good balance for a transcription tool where accuracy and meaning preservation are paramount.
