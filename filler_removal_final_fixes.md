# Filler Removal Final Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Added println! logging
- Added `println!` statements alongside `info!` to ensure logs appear in terminal
- All logs now prefixed with `[SMART FORMATTER]` for easy identification

### 2. Fixed Punctuation Preservation
- When removing "I mean,", we now check if the next word is capitalized
- If capitalized, we insert a period to maintain sentence boundary
- Example: "I mean, We've been working" â†’ ". We've been working"

### 3. Added Limited No-Comma Patterns
- **"should like get/go/do"**: Removes "like" in contexts like "should like get started"
- **"you know the/it/that"**: Removes "you know" when followed by common words
- Still protects phrases like "you know what I mean"

### 4. Improved Handling
- Special replacement logic for context-specific removals
- Better sentence boundary detection
- Maintains grammatical correctness

## To Test:

1. **Stop the current dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Restart**: `npm run tauri dev`
3. **Look for logs** starting with `[SMART FORMATTER]` in the terminal
4. **Test the 3 examples** from FILLER_TEST_EXAMPLES.md

## Expected Behavior:

### Test 1 (with pauses):
- Input: "The new feature is, you know, really important. I mean, we've been working on it for months."
- Output: "The new feature is really important. We've been working on it for months."

### Test 2 (natural flow):
- Input: "So I was thinking about the project and the deadline is approaching. Actually we should probably like get started soon."
- Output: "I was thinking about the project and the deadline is approaching. We should probably get started soon."

### Test 3 (protected phrases):
- Input: "You know what I mean when I say it's important? You know what time the meeting is? But you know, sometimes it's hard to explain."
- Output: "You know what I mean when I say it's important? You know what time the meeting is? But sometimes it's hard to explain."

## What to Look For in Logs:
```
[SMART FORMATTER] Starting filler removal on text (X chars)
[SMART FORMATTER] Input text: '...'
[SMART FORMATTER] Found X protected regions
[SMART FORMATTER] Protected region: 'you know what I mean'
[SMART FORMATTER] Will remove 'you know,' at position X
[SMART FORMATTER] Removing 'you know' at X-Y
[SMART FORMATTER] Final text: '...'
```
