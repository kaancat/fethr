# Smart Formatting Implementation

## Overview
The smart formatting feature automatically adds paragraph breaks to transcribed text based on linguistic patterns and transition phrases.

## How It Works

### 1. Pattern Detection
The system uses a regex pattern to detect transition words that typically indicate new paragraphs:
- So, Now, Next, First, Second, Third, Finally
- However, Therefore, Additionally  
- Let's, Let me, Moving on
- Welcome, Today, By the end

### 2. Confidence Scoring
When a transition pattern is found, the system calculates a confidence score based on:
- **Base score (0.4)**: Given for matching the transition pattern
- **Sentence length (0.3)**: Previous sentence has >10 words
- **Natural boundary (0.2)**: Next sentence doesn't start with "and" or "but"
- **Topic shift (0.2)**: Both segments have >5 words suggesting complete thoughts
- **Pattern matching (0.7 weight)**: Enhanced patterns check for specific phrases

### 3. Enhanced Patterns
The system includes hardcoded patterns with confidence scores:
- **High confidence (0.9)**: ". So ", ". Now ", ". Finally ", ". Moving on"
- **Medium-high (0.85)**: ". Let's ", ". Next ", ". Today ", ". First/Second/Third "
- **Medium (0.8)**: ". Let me ", ". However ", ". Therefore "

### 4. Threshold
A paragraph break is added when confidence â‰¥ 0.65 (lowered from 0.8 for better detection)

## Example
Input: "Welcome to our session. Today we'll cover the basics. So let's begin with the dashboard."

Output: 
```
Welcome to our session. Today we'll cover the basics.

So let's begin with the dashboard.
```

## Implementation Details
- Pure Rust implementation (no Python dependencies)
- Patterns are hardcoded in `boundary_patterns.rs`
- No external model files needed
- Works instantly without any build steps
